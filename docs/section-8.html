<p>[00:04] Me: bruh what the fuck</p>
<p>[00:04] Me: are you still in kyiv</p>
<p>[00:04] Kyiv: yes</p>
<p>[00:04] Me: still at your apartment?</p>
<p>[00:05] Kyiv: no. im with my parents at our country place. it’s not super far away from all the action but it’s safer than my apartment</p>
<p>[00:06] Me: if you intend to leave ukraine</p>
<p>[00:06] Me: i can probably start helping you with a canadian visa</p>
<p>[00:07] Me: i know it aint happening</p>
<p>[00:07] Me: but like</p>
<p>[00:07] Me: if you join the fight</p>
<p>[00:07] Me: i’ll fucking go there and join too i dont know what’s going on anymore</p>
<p>[00:08] Kyiv: thanks</p>
<p>[00:08] Kyiv: i’ll join the fight only as the last resort</p>
<p>[00:08] Kyiv: but im pretty sure im not going anywhere at this point</p>
<p>[00:08] Kyiv: can’t let these fucking russians have what they want</p>
<p>[00:09] Me: last resort</p>
<p>[00:10] Kyiv: honestly, dying seems like a better option</p>
<p>[00:10] Kyiv: wouldn’t want to be russian under any circumstance</p>
<p>[00:10] Kyiv: might be last chance to die ukrainian</p>
<p>[00:12] Kyiv: surprisingly, the ukrainian defences are doing a really good job</p>
<p>[00:15] Me: this is</p>
<p>[00:15] Me: a situation ukraine already got fucked in</p>
<p>[00:15] Me: but what do you think</p>
<p>[00:15] Me: are the chances ukraine remains a country once violence is over</p>
<p>[00:16] Kyiv: i really hope so</p>
<p>[00:16] Kyiv: and i think there’s still hope</p>
<p>[00:16] Kyiv: we will definitely lose some land</p>
<p>[00:17] Kyiv: but as long as we have kiev</p>
<p>[00:17] Kyiv: and the president that i thought was a joke turned out to be a competent leader during these fucked up times</p>
<p>[00:17] Me: i was watching zelenskyy videos</p>
<p>[00:17] Me: no clue what he’s saying</p>
<p>[00:17] Me: but the fact he’s still in kyiv is pretty good</p>
<p>[00:18] Me: man</p>
<p>[00:18] Kyiv: yeah</p>
<p>[00:18] Me: it’s so fucky</p>
<p>[00:18] Me: reading my other discord channels</p>
<p>[00:18] Me: people talking about unbalance in the new total war</p>
<p>[00:18] Me: like it’s the biggest problem</p>
<p>[00:18] Me: when people i know are in warzones</p>
<p>[00:18] Me: kind of surreal</p>
<p>[00:18] Kyiv: yeah. i know</p>
<p>[00:18] Kyiv: my mom said this morning</p>
<p>[00:19] Kyiv: that only now she understands how good everything really was before</p>
<p>[00:20] Kyiv: and our cat shitting in the bathtub being our biggest problem kinda feels unreal now</p>
<p>[00:21] Kyiv: man</p>
<p>[00:22] Kyiv: nobody thought putin was insane enough to start a full scale invasion</p>
<p>[00:22] Kyiv: everyone thought he was bluffing</p>
<p>[00:23] Me: does russia even have allies in this</p>
<p>[00:35] Kyiv: belarus</p>
<p>[00:36] Kyiv: and putin was hoping for kazakhstan to send their forces but they refused</p>
<p>[00:36] Me: isn’t belarus just</p>
<p>[00:37] Me: letting putin go through their territory</p>
<p>[00:37] Me: or are they supporting them in any material way as well</p>
<p>[00:37] Kyiv: we don’t know</p>
<p>[00:38] Kyiv: but the fact that the entire northern border is with belarus grants access to kiev and western regions</p>
<p>[00:38] Kyiv: all shit we have near kiev right now</p>
<p>[00:38] Kyiv: came from belarus</p>
<p>[00:39] Me: do you think they could have stopped russia</p>
<p>[00:39] Me: or would they have just gone through anyway</p>
<p>[00:39] Kyiv: they had no intention to stop anyone. lukashenko is putin’s fuck buddy</p>
<p>[00:41] Me: that makes sense</p>
<p>[00:41] Me: i’m still thinking about</p>
<p>[00:41] Me: which steps could have been preventable</p>
<p>[00:41] Me: but i guess it doesn’t matter to anymore</p>
<p>[00:42] Kyiv: it couldn’t be prevented. a year ago one russian politician slipped that on march of next year we’ll take kiev in 3 days</p>
<p>[00:43] Kyiv: so whatever the fuck is happening right now</p>
<p>[00:43] Kyiv: was planned a long time ago</p>
<p>[00:45] Me: can’t believe russia is sacrificing its relationship with every country to invade ukraine</p>
<p>[00:48] Kyiv: i’ve been trying to understand why he’s doing this but i still don’t understand how all these costs and losses could possibly justify themselves.</p>
<p>[00:49] Kyiv: russia’s economy is going to collapse</p>
<p>[00:49] Kyiv: most diplomatic and financial relationships with russia will be cut</p>
<p>[00:50] Kyiv: all this for a plot of land full of people who will keep fighting even if the war is already
lost</p>
<p>[00:51] Kyiv: even the british minister is saying that everything that’s happening is illogical and putin has probably gone insane</p>
<p>[00:52] Me: is this just some</p>
<p>[00:52] Me: bullshit power trip</p>
<p>[00:52] Me: where he’s just too upset ukraine is not russia</p>
<p>[00:53] Me: i really wonder what the public in russia thinks</p>
<p>[00:53] Me: can’t imagine anyone thinking this is helpful to them</p>
<p>[00:55] Kyiv: old retards who actually voted for putin still support him. they believe the russian news even when it’s complete bullshit. a lot of people appear to be brainwashed</p>
<p>[00:56] Kyiv: young people are out in the streets, protesting against the war</p>
<p>[00:56] Kyiv: almost 2000 were already arrested</p>
<p>[00:57] Kyiv: i don’t know what putin was hoping for but he might have dug up his own grave.</p>
<p>[07:09] Kyiv: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRc9htfOLiw" class="uri">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRc9htfOLiw</a></p>
<p>[07:09] Kyiv: damn</p>
<p>[11:33] Me: man this is just like the winter war</p>
<p>[11:33] Me: fuck them up bruh</p>
<p>[12:02] Me: man</p>
<p>[12:02] Me: being like</p>
<p>[12:02] Me: ilya do you want to play stardew valley</p>
<p>[12:02] Me: feels like a really long time ago</p>
<p>[12:02] Me: but it was actually less than a month wasn’t it</p>
<p>[12:38] Kyiv: fucking putin</p>
<p>[12:38] Kyiv: penis head</p>
<p>[13:11] Me: this is making me wonder about myself</p>
<p>[13:11] Me: if ____ gets invaded, how hard would i work</p>
<p>[13:11] Me: i think in the end</p>
<p>[13:11] Me: all i can do is align with people who look like me</p>
<p>[13:15] Kyiv: in the end, it’s about how you feel toward your nation. some people have no problem leaving their homeland without looking back even for a split second, others can’t leave knowing their home is being invaded. both have justifiable reasons</p>
<p>[13:15] Kyiv: i can see myself being both</p>
<p>[13:15] Kyiv: but this time i choose to stay</p>
<p>[13:16] Kyiv: artillery strike in 10min</p>
<p>[13:16] Kyiv: ttyl</p>
<p>[14:01] Me: good luck</p>
