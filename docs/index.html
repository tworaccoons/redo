<p>[20:23] Kyiv: i think the war has begun</p>
<p>[20:30] Me: have you decided what you‚Äôre going to do</p>
<p>[20:30] Me: are you staying in ukraine or leaving</p>
<p>[21:05] Kyiv: the borders are going to be closed</p>
<p>[21:05] Kyiv: probably gonna go to the western ukraine if shit really hits the fan</p>
<p>[21:05] Kyiv: just hoping for a diplomatic resolution</p>
<p>[21:05] Kyiv: but i think putin will get some more land first</p>
<p>[21:39] Me: i feel like</p>
<p>[21:39] Me: this just a play</p>
<p>[21:39] Me: so ukraine will have to give them the land held by separatists</p>
<p>[21:39] Me: but if it gets worse</p>
<p>[21:39] Me: you‚Äôre pretty fucked</p>
<p>[21:39] Kyiv: yes</p>
<p>[21:40] Me: if it‚Äôs actual open war you can‚Äôt join because you can‚Äôt betray the ones who need you</p>
<p>[21:40] Me: but you also can‚Äôt not join</p>
<p>[21:40] Me: because that‚Äôs absolute betrayal of everyone</p>
<p>[21:41] Kyiv: that‚Äôs not betrayal. why should anyone be forced to fight the wars that a few rarts started. they may go ahead resolve the issue with a duel. that would be top tier entertainment</p>
<p>[21:42] Me: it‚Äôs only a betrayal of the people you know who actually joined</p>
<p>[21:42] Kyiv: i don‚Äôt even know anyone crazy enough to join</p>
<p>[21:43] Kyiv: everyone i know says they‚Äôre either gonna get the fuck out of here or stay home and watch netflix</p>
<p>[21:44] Me: damn</p>
<p>[21:44] Me: at least you have netflix</p>
<p>[21:44] Me: just come here</p>
<p>[21:44] Kyiv: cant</p>
<p>[21:44] Kyiv: no visa</p>
<p>[21:44] Kyiv: no monies</p>

drafted by force. the tanks are already moving in from three different directions.</p>
<p>[00:19] Kyiv: guess im staying</p>
<p>[00:29] Me: bruh</p>
<p>[00:29] Me: if you fucking</p>
<p>[00:29] Me: die from this</p>
<p>[00:29] Me: i will make the world remember you</p>
<p>[00:30] Kyiv: i wish to be the most useless character in a zoltan story</p>
<p>[00:31] Me: i‚Äôll name the king who dies from falling in the toilet after you</p>
<p>[17:40] Me: is kyiv going to fall at this rate</p>
<p>[17:40] Me: if you‚Äôre planning on going elsewhere, might as well be earlier as opposed to later</p>
<p>[18:23] Kyiv: i dont know</p>

<p>[08:54] Kyiv: honestly, i didn‚Äôt expect the ukrainian army to do so well</p>
<p>[08:55] Kyiv: really thought russia could blitzkrieg through the entire country in one day</p>
<p>[08:55] Kyiv: with barely any casualties</p>
<p>[11:00] Me: Which regions are the ones with Ukrainian separatists</p>
<p>[11:00] Me: It‚Äôs only the two, right</p>
<p>[11:00] Kyiv: far right</p>
<p>[11:00] Kyiv: donetsk and lugansk</p>

<p>[00:04] Kyiv: yes</p>
<p>[00:04] Me: still at your apartment?</p>
<p>[00:05] Kyiv: no. im with my parents at our country place. it‚Äôs not super far away from all the action but it‚Äôs safer than my apartment</p>
<p>[00:06] Me: if you intend to leave ukraine</p>
<p>[00:06] Me: i can probably start helping you with a canadian visa</p>
<p>[00:07] Me: i know it aint happening</p>
<p>[00:07] Me: but like</p>
<p>[00:07] Me: if you join the fight</p>
<p>[00:07] Me: i‚Äôll fucking go there and join too i dont know what‚Äôs going on anymore</p>
<p>[00:08] Kyiv: thanks</p>
<p>[00:08] Kyiv: i‚Äôll join the fight only as the last resort</p>
<p>[00:08] Kyiv: but im pretty sure im not going anywhere at this point</p>
<p>[00:08] Kyiv: can‚Äôt let these fucking russians have what they want</p>
<p>[00:09] Me: last resort</p>
<p>[00:10] Kyiv: honestly, dying seems like a better option</p>
<p>[00:10] Kyiv: wouldn‚Äôt want to be russian under any circumstance</p>
<p>[00:10] Kyiv: might be last chance to die ukrainian</p>
<p>[00:12] Kyiv: surprisingly, the ukrainian defences are doing a really good job</p>
<p>[00:15] Me: this is</p>
<p>[00:15] Me: a situation ukraine already got fucked in</p>
<p>[00:15] Me: but what do you think</p>
<p>[00:15] Me: are the chances ukraine remains a country once violence is over</p>
<p>[00:16] Kyiv: i really hope so</p>
<p>[00:16] Kyiv: and i think there‚Äôs still hope</p>
<p>[00:16] Kyiv: we will definitely lose some land</p>
<p>[00:17] Kyiv: but as long as we have kiev</p>
<p>[00:17] Kyiv: and the president that i thought was a joke turned out to be a competent leader during these fucked up times</p>
<p>[00:17] Me: i was watching zelenskyy videos</p>
<p>[00:17] Me: no clue what he‚Äôs saying</p>
<p>[00:17] Me: but the fact he‚Äôs still in kyiv is pretty good</p>
<p>[00:18] Me: man</p>
<p>[00:18] Kyiv: yeah</p>
<p>[00:18] Me: it‚Äôs so fucky</p>
<p>[00:18] Me: reading my other discord channels</p>
<p>[00:18] Me: people talking about unbalance in the new total war</p>
<p>[00:18] Me: like it‚Äôs the biggest problem</p>
<p>[00:18] Me: when people i know are in warzones</p>
<p>[00:18] Me: kind of surreal</p>
<p>[00:18] Kyiv: yeah. i know</p>
<p>[00:18] Kyiv: my mom said this morning</p>
<p>[00:19] Kyiv: that only now she understands how good everything really was before</p>
<p>[00:20] Kyiv: and our cat shitting in the bathtub being our biggest problem kinda feels unreal
now</p>
<p>[00:21] Kyiv: man</p>
<p>[00:22] Kyiv: nobody thought putin was insane enough to start a full scale invasion</p>
<p>[00:22] Kyiv: everyone thought he was bluffing</p>
<p>[00:23] Me: does russia even have allies in this</p>
<p>[00:35] Kyiv: belarus</p>
<p>[00:36] Kyiv: and putin was hoping for kazakhstan to send their forces but they refused</p>
<p>[00:36] Me: isn‚Äôt belarus just</p>
<p>[00:37] Me: letting putin go through their territory</p>
<p>[00:37] Me: or are they supporting them in any material way as well</p>
<p>[00:37] Kyiv: we don‚Äôt know</p>
<p>[00:38] Kyiv: but the fact that the entire northern border is with belarus grants access to kiev and western regions</p>
<p>[00:38] Kyiv: all shit we have near kiev right now</p>
<p>[00:38] Kyiv: came from belarus</p>
<p>[00:39] Me: do you think they could have stopped russia</p>
<p>[00:39] Me: or would they have just gone through anyway</p>
<p>[00:39] Kyiv: they had no intention to stop anyone. lukashenko is putin‚Äôs fuck buddy</p>
<p>[00:41] Me: that makes sense</p>
<p>[00:41] Me: i‚Äôm still thinking about</p>
<p>[00:41] Me: which steps could have been preventable</p>
<p>[00:41] Me: but i guess it doesn‚Äôt matter to anymore</p>
<p>[00:42] Kyiv: it couldn‚Äôt be prevented. a year ago one russian politician slipped that on march of next year we‚Äôll take kiev in 3 days</p>
<p>[00:43] Kyiv: so whatever the fuck is happening right now</p>
<p>[00:43] Kyiv: was planned a long time ago</p>
<p>[00:45] Me: can‚Äôt believe russia is sacrificing its relationship with every country to invade ukraine</p>
<p>[00:48] Kyiv: i‚Äôve been trying to understand why he‚Äôs doing this but i still don‚Äôt understand how all these costs and losses could possibly justify themselves.</p>
<p>[00:49] Kyiv: russia‚Äôs economy is going to collapse</p>
<p>[00:49] Kyiv: most diplomatic and financial relationships with russia will be cut</p>
<p>[00:50] Kyiv: all this for a plot of land full of people who will keep fighting even if the war is already lost</p>
<p>[00:51] Kyiv: even the british minister is saying that everything that‚Äôs happening is illogical and putin has probably gone insane</p>
<p>[00:52] Me: is this just some</p>
<p>[00:52] Me: bullshit power trip</p>
<p>[00:52] Me: where he‚Äôs just too upset ukraine is not russia</p>
<p>[00:53] Me: i really wonder what the public in russia thinks</p>
<p>[00:53] Me: can‚Äôt imagine anyone thinking this is helpful to them</p>
<p>[00:55] Kyiv: old retards who actually voted for putin still support him. they believe the russian news even when it‚Äôs complete bullshit. a lot of people appear to be brainwashed</p>
<p>[00:56] Kyiv: young people are out in the streets, protesting against the war</p>
<p>[00:56] Kyiv: almost 2000 were already arrested</p>
<p>[00:57] Kyiv: i don‚Äôt know what putin was hoping for but he might have dug up his own grave.</p>
<p>[07:09] Kyiv: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRc9htfOLiw" class="uri">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRc9htfOLiw</a></p>
<p>[07:09] Kyiv: damn</p>
<p>[11:33] Me: man this is just like the winter war</p>
<p>[11:33] Me: fuck them up bruh</p>
<p>[12:02] Me: man</p>
<p>[12:02] Me: being like</p>
<p>[12:02] Me: do you want to play stardew valley</p>
<p>[12:02] Me: feels like a really long time ago</p>
<p>[12:02] Me: but it was actually less than a month wasn‚Äôt it</p>
<p>[12:38] Kyiv: fucking putin</p>
<p>[12:38] Kyiv: penis head</p>
<p>[13:11] Me: this is making me wonder about myself</p>
<p>[13:11] Me: if ____ gets invaded, how hard would i work</p>
<p>[13:11] Me: or if ____ gets invaded, how hard would i work</p>
<p>[13:11] Me: i think in the end</p>
<p>[13:11] Me: all i can do is align with people who look like me</p>
<p>[13:15] Kyiv: in the end, it‚Äôs about how you feel toward your nation. some people have no problem leaving their homeland without looking back even for a split second, others can‚Äôt leave knowing their home is being invaded. both have justifiable reasons</p>
<p>[13:15] Kyiv: i can see myself being both</p>
<p>[13:15] Kyiv: but this time i choose to stay</p>
<p>[13:16] Kyiv: artillery strike in 10min</p>
<p>[13:16] Kyiv: ttyl</p>
<p>[14:01] Me: good luck</p>

<p>[01:00] Me: already i‚Äôll see if it goes anywhere</p>
<p>[01:00] Me: talk to people about mediums tomorrow</p>
<p>[01:00] Me: man i dont know</p>
<p>[01:01] Me: feels like it‚Äôs in poor taste since everything is still currently fucked</p>
<p>[01:01] Me: but it might be good to get perspective out there</p>
<p>[01:01] Me: since all the news is created by people who aren‚Äôt even there</p>
<p>[01:01] Kyiv: i scan the local news, bbc, cnn, nyt, and the russian news</p>
<p>[01:02] Kyiv: russians are just living in a parallel universe</p>
<p>[01:02] Kyiv: they say they dont have any casualties</p>
<p>[01:02] Kyiv: and they are successfully liberating ukrainians from the nazi rule</p>
<p>[01:03] Kyiv: in the meantime more than 20k civilians took arms to defend against russians</p>
<p>[01:03] Kyiv: already a lot of footage of people mass producing molotovs</p>
<p>[01:03] Kyiv: to defend against btrs</p>

<p>[01:04] Me: man you know</p>
<p>[01:04] Me: i was talking with ____</p>
<p>[01:04] Me: and she mentioned how some people on chinese social media are not taking it seriously</p>
<p>[01:04] Me: and i was thinking</p>
<p>[01:04] Me: getting invaded by an overwhelming force</p>
<p>[01:05] Me: all the civilians taking up arms and making homemade explosives to put up a futile fight</p>
<p>[01:05] Me: is just like the resistance against the japanese</p>
<p>[01:05] Me: but everyone still feels disconnected</p>
<p>[01:06] Me: to people forget about history too quickly or do people just not care about anythng happening directly to them</p>
<p>[01:06] Kyiv: either</p>
<p>[01:09] Kyiv: just got an update in the civilan force</p>
<p>[01:09] Kyiv: 37k in kiev alone</p>
<p>[01:11] Me: how is it recorded</p>
<p>[01:11] Me: do people register or is it an estimate</p>
<p>[01:11] Kyiv: everyone has to register</p>
<p>[01:12] Me: how does the civilian registeration work</p>

<p>[01:13] Me: oh yeah i saw that one</p>
<p>[01:14] Me: do ukrainians generally have weapons at home</p>
<p>[01:14] Me: like can you just go outside with whatever you have and just shoot them</p>
<p>[01:14] Me: because 37k seems like a low number</p>
<p>[01:14] Me: for the civilian resistance</p>
<p>[01:14] Me: you got 3 million people in the city and only 37k want to fight?</p>
<p>[01:14] Kyiv: thats just the ones who officially registered</p>
<p>[01:14] Kyiv: and it‚Äôs only in kiev</p>
<p>[01:15] Kyiv: it‚Äôs only the third day. i think the number will keep growing</p>

<p>[01:15] Kyiv: not yet</p>

<p>[01:32] Kyiv: i mean</p>
<p>[01:32] Kyiv: tar is optional</p>

<p>[01:33] Me: just fill bottles with petrol alcohol and styrofoam and go protest your favourite hockey team losing</p>
<p>[01:33] Me: extra canadian</p>
<p>[01:33] Me: if it can burn down a cosmetics store it can probably kill russians</p>
<p>[01:33] Kyiv: can‚Äôt imagine caring about a sport team losing</p>
<p>[01:34] Me: honestly since what‚Äôs happening</p>

<p>[00:36] Kyiv: looters</p>
<p>[00:36] Kyiv: yer money or yer life</p>
<p>[00:37] Me: the fuck happened to them</p>
<p>[00:37] Kyiv: they got caught looting</p>
<p>[00:38] Kyiv: they‚Äôre lucky to be alive cuz there was an order to shoot looters on sight</p>
<p>[00:38] Me: are they just</p>
<p>[00:39] Me: ukrianians who started looting because things were going to shit</p>
<p>[00:39] Kyiv: ye</p>
<p>[00:39] Me: you best not be a manhunter</p>
<p>[00:39] Kyiv: traitors</p>

<p>[00:40] Me: reverse google search no results</p>
<p>[00:41] Kyiv: people also tie looters to lampposts with stretch foil and call the police</p>
<p>[00:41] Kyiv: reminds me of spoderman movies</p>
<p>[00:41] Kyiv: when he just shot looters with his jizz and called the police</p>

<p>[00:47] Me: man</p>

<p>[00:48] Me: good times</p>
<p>[00:48] Kyiv: ye</p>
<p>[00:48] Kyiv: the only good thing about that game</p>
<p>[00:49] Me: this is so sad despacito kill myself</p>
<p>[00:50] Me: how do police even have time to deal with looters</p>
<p>[00:51] Kyiv: i dont even know. there are a lot of volunteers that patrol the streets. they are the ones that catch the looters. the police arrest them whenever they have time i guess.</p>
<p>[00:51] Kyiv: so they could be tied to the lampposts for hours</p>
<p>[00:52] Me: classic manhunters</p>
<p>[00:52] Kyiv: what r u doing r n</p>
<p>[00:52] Me: makes sense it‚Äôs a shit time to be looting</p>
<p>[00:52] Me: applying to jobs</p>
<p>[00:52] Me: i got rejected to 8 more since we last spoke</p>
<p>[00:52] Kyiv: gg</p>
<p>Kyiv started a call that lasted an hour.</p>
<p>2-3 voice</p>
<p>(unrecorded conversation)</p>
<p>Kyiv: I think they were just expecting to be greeted with flowers like they were in donesk and luhansk, but when they went deeper, old people in villages were throwing themselves under tanks to stop them.</p>
<p>Our defence minister said, they will keep being greeted with flowers but they will be on their graves.</p>
<p>Me: I guess for Ukraine, nationalism and patriotism is only really high right now because it‚Äôs just
gotten attacked. But the fact that so many civilians are willing to just die for the cause right now. I feel like most places in the world, among the general populace at least, they just don‚Äôt have that</p>
<p>Kyiv: I guess there‚Äôs just an ongoing struggle for freedom and identity that kind of instils this patriotism and nationalism in people. Like constant wars and oppression from Russian side, 20th century was basically hell. It was like you were persecuted just for being Ukrainian. So that kind of instils that strong identity when you‚Äôre among Russians. When you live in Soviet Union, and you‚Äôre Ukrainian and they hear you speak Ukrainian, then you‚Äôre instantly a fucking low life retard, so you have to speak Russian so that people don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre retarded.</p>
<p>Me: That makes sense</p>
<p>Kyiv: of that kind of, you know. There‚Äôs perpetual anger growing inside of you, toward Russians, and a kind of longing to be Ukrainian and to finally have a country and nation that‚Äôs united and strong enough to fend off all the‚ÄìI guess‚Äìavenge all the things that happened.</p>
<p>Me: I guess if you put it like that, it‚Äôs like the experience I‚Äôve been discussing with my ____ recently. There‚Äôs just a lot of similarities with the resistance against the Japanese he was there for, you know? It‚Äôs not really necessarily liking a country or idea to a certain degree, but you eventually get tired of being slaves. And everyone who just doesn‚Äôt want to be slaves and have barely anything else in common just unite.</p>
<p>Kyiv: I guess that makes sense.</p>
<p>Me: What a time to fucking be alive bro. Didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd fucking see this shit. Well, you know what? I guess I did think I would see this day eventually. Just not so soon, you know?</p>
<p>Kyiv: Man, everyone thought Putin was bluffing. Except for Americans, they were like ‚Äòbruh they‚Äôre gonna invade at any time now.‚Äô But Ukrainians were like ‚Äònah, bro are you joking?‚Äô</p>
<p>Me: bro look at this though. I still have a cat at least</p>
<p>Kyiv: piece of shit.</p>
<p>Me: Aw man</p>
<p>So, it‚Äôs been a few days What do you think the chances of Ukraine still being in country by the time this shit‚Äôs over</p>
<p>Kyiv: Chances are pretty high, the question is how much damage will we endure? Because Russians have been bombing major cities, destroying old infrastructure, hospitals, kindergartens, schools, just regular buildings where people live. There‚Äôs already a lot of damage done and it‚Äôs not over yet</p>
<p>Me: that makes sense</p>
<p>Kyiv: and how much of it how much land we‚Äôll be able to retain by the end</p>
<p>Me: Kind of weird that, militarily, in terms of like actual military forces not just like, Bro you want like five bullets? Isn‚Äôt it kinda funny that there are countries sending military to help Russia but no one‚Äôs helping Ukraine even though the entire world‚Äôs like ‚Äòaw man, pray for Ukraine‚Äô</p>
<p>Kyiv: What do you mean military, do you mean Belarus</p>
<p>Me: Is it just Belarus?</p>
<p>Kyiv: Well, I mean, there are Chechens but Chechens are part of Russia. I mean, Ukraine is now opening for volunteers from several countries the chechen that fled the country during the war kind of want to go back to Ukraine and fight the chechen that won the war because the Chechen that won the war are all retarded. There are Belarusians in Ukraine that disagree with Lukashenko and they, too, want to join the war. The Foreign Legion, dutch volunteers, well I mean there‚Äôs several. It‚Äôs not a lot but it‚Äôs still something</p>
<p>Me: I guess it helps morale at least</p>
<p>Kyiv: Yeah, well the weapons are good and apparently Russians cannot fucking fight. Like I don‚Äôt know what the fuck their strategy is but they‚Äôve already lost a shit ton. A convoy‚Äôs just been deployed here and it all immediately got destroyed by fucking Turkish planes and whatever gets close to the cities, or is already in the cities, gets destroyed by a fucking military or paramilitary stingers and javelins.</p>
<p>Me: Fuck I was expecting just babushkas and molotovs bruh</p>
<p>Kyiv: Well that happens, too. In villages, people make molotovs and they destroyed btr‚Äôs</p>
<p>Me: Frugal living</p>
<p>Yeah I remember when we talked when this first started? You were like, fuck, I guess we will disappear in five minutes. And then somehow Ukraine is doing well. Well, I guess you can‚Äôt really do well in this situation but it‚Äôs not as bad as expected</p>
<p>Kyiv: Ukrainian military is doing surprisingly well. That‚Äôs pretty good. And a lot of people are coming back from other countries, my dad‚Äôs friend from childhood who lives in Canada is already on the way to the Ukraine to fight the war.</p>
<p>Me: fuck I wish I was on the way</p>
<p>Man, I was super ready to join the Foreign Legion I was like fuck if I‚Äôm gonna die I might as well be fighting the Russians bro there‚Äôs no better way to die (private)</p>
<p>Kyiv:
just like in Call of Duty</p>
<p>Me: exactly</p>
<p>Kyiv: I was always asking myself like why do they always make Russians the enemy until now</p>
<p>Me: Do you remember that one satire video about a Call of Duty pro player who joined ISIS and then got quickscoped that‚Äôs a classic</p>
<p>Then they asked his friends what do you think happened and they said, fuck, maybe he got fucking spawncamped by some asshole. You got to spawn camp the Russians dude, just go to Moscow now.</p>
<p>Kyiv: Holy shit bro, just kill Putin.</p>
<p>Putin is just sitting in some bunker. Nobody knows where he is.</p>
<p>Me: I guess we saw that coming. Man, is Zelenskyy still in Kyiv. That‚Äôs pretty impressive, didn‚Äôt the last two presidents both flee to Russia or something?</p>
<p>Kyiv: Well, in 2014, the president, the prime minister and some other fucking politicians fled to Russia and they‚Äôre still in Russia. I think I saw them on the news just a few days ago. They‚Äôre all like, Well, yeah, there is a Nazi rule in Ukraine, so you got to liberate the country. And I was like, Oh man, there was Poroshenko he was a president for like four or five years.</p>
<p>Me: I mean,</p>
<p>Kyiv: Part of the reason why this defense was so successful was due to Poroshenko. He had many faults, like his way of dealing with the oligarchs was just kind of sus. But he kind of reinvented the training military, because everything before that were just non existant. There was zero budget, and in the military, we had no soldiers and nothing. When the war in Donbass started, he started investing a lot of money in military so at least when Russia invaded we had some soldiers and military bases and defences</p>
<p>Me: You think you‚Äôre going to fight?</p>
<p>Kyiv: Well, people who volunteer to fight say that there‚Äôs like fucking three guns for 10 people because they‚Äôre just too many volunteers and not enough weaponry. So if I were to join now, I wouldn‚Äôt have a weapon, I will just be following the others while catching looters and tying them to lightpoles.</p>
<p>Me: yeah so instead of joining a kingdom, you can just be the roaming war party just fighting looters. That‚Äôs just the early game, you know, then you can go to tournaments.</p>
<p>Kyiv: Can I quicksave?</p>
<p>Me: This is like one of those times when you start the game and say don‚Äôt let me quit without saving then you get stuck in a wall and lose all your progress.</p>
<p>Kyiv: Worse than dying bruh</p>
<p>Me: I guess catching looters is pretty important, other people need that shit</p>
<p>Kyiv: We do construction so we got an order from the Ukrainian military to construct hedgehogs.</p>
<p>Me: Don‚Äôt you guys only have four people working for you?</p>
<p>Kyiv: Around four people in the office but here‚Äôs like 20 people at the factory</p>
<p>Me: That‚Äôs good because I remember last time I was talking to you about it and you were driving like, ‚Äòyeah, I need to go to the factory because someone else was supposed to go but he disappeared‚Äô</p>
<p>Kyiv: I don‚Äôt know, everything‚Äôs fucking gone dude</p>
<p>Me: Was it like the guy who got kidnapped and chained to the radiator</p>
<p>What are you guys building</p>
<p>Kyiv: hedgehogs</p>
<p>Me: what are those</p>
<p>Kyiv: Have you seen clips from war movies, like on the beach at d-day, the fucking giant metal spikes?</p>
<p>Me: Oh, those are called hedgehogs, I didn‚Äôt even know that</p>
<p>Kyiv: Yeah, just to stop tanks</p>
<p>Me: I wrote about them in this story, I called them barricades because I googled spiky shit and it didn‚Äôt come up with anything</p>
<p>Kyiv: come on bro</p>
<p>Me: fuck</p>
<p>Kyiv: It‚Äôs so hard to do anything useful. If I go there there‚Äôs nothing for me to do since no weapons, if I stay here, there‚Äôs nothing for me to do since I‚Äôm just watching them build. So fucking useless</p>
<p>Me: Make molotovs at home</p>
<p>Kyiv: No ingredients. At home I have a pistol with rubber bullets, most I can do is probably shoot myself in the head</p>
<p>Me: You probably won‚Äôt even die, just hurts</p>
<p>Kyiv: you can actually die</p>
<p>Me: well it depends like the gun right</p>
<p>Kyiv: it‚Äôs a 9 mil pistol</p>
<p>Me: guess it depends more on the bullet</p>
<p>Kyiv: there‚Äôs still gunpowder in it, just the metal part is replaced with rubber</p>
<p>Me: severe brain damage</p>
<p>Kyiv: if you get shot in the eye or the temple or maybe even the liver, you might die</p>
<p>Me: Remember that meme about stalker with the guy holding pistol like shotgun and it just says you won‚Äôt miss because fear of shooting hand</p>
<p>I remember this video of a guy playing vr Counter Strike. And he was dual wielding AKs. But if you hold it in one hand, if you shoot one bullet, the recoil would just knock it out your hand. So he tried to rush the door with the AKs and he only shot two bullets and both guns bounced off and then he died.</p>
<p>Kyiv: Remember we played paintball and _____ was there just going fucking terminator mode and would hold two guns and he would just walk like this with two guns and shoot at the tent where people are hiding. But like while he was walking there, he got shot like 20 times but he wouldn‚Äôt stop</p>
<p>Me: I know, I was one of the people who shot him</p>
<p>good times</p>

<p>[14:35] Kyiv: everything that didn‚Äôt make sense would make even less sense</p>
<p>[14:36] Me: i feel like i haven‚Äôt been living in different reality for so long</p>
<p>[14:36] Me: real life is just absolute insanity</p>
<p>[14:36] Me: everything is a paradox</p>
<p>[14:36] Me: gotta fucking</p>
<p>[14:36] Me: retreat back into my corner of perplexity bruh</p>
<p>[14:37] Kyiv: mr gibson would approve</p>
<p>[14:37] Kyiv: can‚Äôt fucking believe this shit is happening</p>
<p>[14:38] Kyiv: biden warned everyone that the attack was imminent but people just couldn;t fathom this course of events</p>
<p>[14:38] Kyiv: it just defied any logic</p>
<p>[14:38] Kyiv: and then all of a sudden it became reality</p>
<p>[14:38] Kyiv: and everyone was like</p>
<p>[14:38] Kyiv: shenme</p>
<p>[14:40] Me: yea man</p>
<p>[14:40] Me: russians came</p>
<p>[14:40] Me: and ukrainians were like</p>
<p>[14:40] Me: Âπ≤Âêó</p>
<p>[14:40] Kyiv: the nuclear threat is kinda fucked tho</p>
<p>[14:41] Kyiv: can‚Äôt even get iodine pills anywhere</p>
<p>[14:41] Me: man</p>
<p>[14:42] Me: aren‚Äôt private pharm companies starting to supply them</p>
<p>[14:43] Kyiv: russians‚Äô kadirov troops which are basically muslim extremists took over the chernobyl and zaporozhian nuclear power plants</p>
<p>[14:44] Kyiv: can‚Äôt predict anything when those fgts are involved</p>
<p>[14:44] Kyiv: the pills are all out of stock</p>
<p>[14:45] Me: fuck</p>
<p>[14:47] Me: oh it‚Äôs chechens</p>
<p>[14:47] Me: i can see that being worrying</p>
<p>[14:48] Kyiv: the chechens that fled the chechen wars in russia are now fighting on our side now</p>
<p>[14:49] Kyiv: that‚Äôs a good thing since they are well trained and have personal hatred toward russian chechens</p>
<p>[14:51] Kyiv: NATO‚Äôs inability to help out with troops and securing ukraine‚Äôs airspace is kinda
frustrating but i guess we‚Äôll just have to do with what we have</p>
<p>[14:51] Kyiv: the promised jets are taking a while tho</p>
<p>[14:51] Me: i mean it‚Äôs like</p>
<p>[14:51] Me: does nato really want to be a friend of ukraine</p>
<p>[14:52] Me: or do they just want russia to take as many losses as possible</p>
<p>[14:52] Me: without costing them anything</p>
<p>[14:52] Kyiv: in my opinion</p>
<p>[14:52] Kyiv: nato just wants russia to lose</p>
<p>[14:52] Kyiv: but they don‚Äôt want an open conflict with them</p>
<p>[14:52] Kyiv: cuz it would essentially mean ww3</p>
<p>[14:53] Kyiv: so they are just supplying us with weapons</p>
<p>[14:53] Kyiv: disregarding the losses we might endure</p>
<p>[14:54] Kyiv: im at the same time grateful and displeased</p>
<p>[14:55] Kyiv: what are you doing rn</p>
<p>[14:55] Me: being depressed</p>
<p>[14:55] Kyiv: good</p>
<p>Kyiv</p>
<p>started a call that lasted 2 hours.</p>
<p>(unrecorded conversation)</p>
<p>Kyiv: If we can hold kyiv for 7 days, we might have a chance to fight back</p>
<p>Me: Is there a specific reason for like seven days or</p>
<p>Kyiv: There is a specific reason, it‚Äôs because he utilised 9% of the fucking military force that he planted across the fucking border. And everything fucking went sideways. So within seven days, the army that he amassed at the borders is going to be destroyed if we hold on the resistance and if Kiev doesn‚Äôt collapse because he has already run out of supplies, because he has been bombarding the fucking cities non-stop he‚Äôs running out of fucking ammunition. And the factories that manufacture ammunition cannot supply him with enough ammunition to keep going. So he kind of went all in on Ukraine, but he failed because he did not anticipate the kind of resistance and the support from the woods. Because he thought that wasn‚Äôt going to do the same shit as Donbass and Crimea, just ignore the issue</p>
<p>Me: I watched a seminar about this, it was like an older recorded one from like, 2015 or so when Crimea was just taken. They mentioned how the West wanted to expand influence into Ukraine without making Ukraine a part of EU or NATO. And Russia wanted Ukraine to be like, how do you say, kind of like a border country between Russia and the West,.</p>
<p>Kyiv: It expands beyond that. If you listen to Russian news, I mean, with subtitles, or if you took enough Russian classes, you can just watch the originals, it‚Äôs fucking insane. He basically says that we‚Äôre a brother nation and he‚Äôs liberating us from the Nazi role. And he wants to reunite Ukraine and Russia, basically to reinstate the USSR. And the majority of Russian people support it. Just a few days ago, there was a fucking, you know like, street kind of questionnaire, I suppose. They were like, do you want to see pictures from Ukraine after the invasion? And do you still support Putin and after you see these pictures, and a lot of people are like, I don‚Äôt even want to see the pictures, I support Putin because He‚Äôs our leader, and he is liberating Ukraine from the Nazi rule. And at this point, I‚Äôm just questioning myself. Before I was like, okay, Russian people, they just have to unite. Like the youth has to unite and just like basically, go for revolution at this point, because that‚Äôs the only way but now, I think that Russia has to be fucking nuked. There‚Äôs just no hope for Russia because the majority of people is not the youth, it is the people who support Putin.</p>
<p>Me: This is insane. to even think about. This feels like something</p>
<p>Kyiv: All the fucking opposition TV channels, radio stations and media channels were closed because they were talking about Russia invading Ukraine, and the whole mentioning of Russia invading Ukraine and not being the fucking special operation, as they call it, and not a liberation mission is basically a national crime now, and anyone who says that Russia is invading Ukraine is going to be sentenced to 15 years in jail. It‚Äôs basically becoming North Korea this point.</p>
<p>Me: it‚Äôs hard to even imagine that this is shit that‚Äôs happening now, you know. I guess the last time something like this happened that was comparable was when the Americans invaded Iraq but that was almost 20 years ago</p>
<p>Kyiv: I don‚Äôt know bro the kind of broken propaganda that‚Äôs happening in Russia right now use like the Soviet propaganda because the even released the fucking cartoons for kids that Ukraine was friends with Russia. But then Ukraine went to a different button class and they met Americans and European countries. That‚Äôs like an actual fucking cartoon, Ukraine went to different class, they got new friends and then they started chasing after the fucking proclaimed Donetsk and Lugansk Republics. They‚Äôre actually like kids in fucking flags. Their clothes are painted in flags, and Ukraine is chasing after them with a stick and Russia is standing up for them. The pinnacle of that cartoon is that Russia takes the stick from the Ukrainian kid. And the kids in like dress in the fucking American and European clothes. They‚Äôre like shaming that fucking Russian kid for taking the stick from Ukrainian kid. When my mom watched that cartoon, she was like, bruh this is fucking USSR, this is the shit we watched when we were fucking kids. Russia is basically regressing into USSR but at this point they have even less power than before.</p>
<p>Me: I don‚Äôt know. Some people I‚Äôm talking to are like, man, you know, it‚Äôs not the Russians is just Putin. But like I don‚Äôt know, where does Putin‚Äôs power come from, right, like there‚Äôs people who support him. If like everyone in Russia didn‚Äôt like Putin, this wouldn‚Äôt happen.</p>
<p>Kyiv: [russian] people in the streets that are fighting for independence, for Ukraine I suppose or at least to stop the work, I‚Äôm thankful to those people, but the people who support Putin, or who are neutral they‚Äôre basically the enemies of the state. Because people who are neutral and do not take stance on either one of those positions are basically supporting Putin because inactivity indirectly supports Putin.</p>
<p>Me: I guess that makes sense. I‚Äôm just thinking if you were a Russian in Russia, and you didn‚Äôt support the war, what would you do? Do you protest and get arrested instantly? Do you like defect to Ukraine? Like how many options do you really have, you know?</p>
<p>Kyiv: Well, it‚Äôs hard to say from this position that I am in right now. But hypothetically, I would probably go out and protest because it‚Äôs the only chance to overtake the government because revolutions always ends in blood, a proper revolution, the kind that has effect. Whatever the fuck they doing right now is not having any effect because they‚Äôre fucking pussies. Just like the revolution that we had in the fucking 2014 People went on the streets and a lot of people died but we had new democratic government, but democracy, I feel like democracy is just like an unknown concept to Russia. They just long for a fucking monarchy or autocracy?</p>
<p>Me: Wasn‚Äôt the Ukrainian president that got overthrown democratically elected?</p>
<p>Kyiv: No, he rigged the election just like Lukashenko did. A lot of people voted for him, but it wasn‚Äôt enough to get the victory so he rigged the election. People kind of revolted then, but it was kind of subdued. But when it all really started when he promised the Ukrainian people that he would join the EU. But then he went to the Congress, and he said that he would not join the EU because it would worsen the relationship with Russia and it wouldn‚Äôt wouldn‚Äôt be in the interest of Ukraine to join the EU and that‚Äôs when the people finally revolted because they were like, we want to have nothing to do with fucking Russia because they‚Äôre fucking retarded and they‚Äôre oppressing, we want to be a part of EU because we don‚Äôt want to be in USSR at this point. Then it just fucking went sideways and a lot of people died but he fled to Russia and so did a lot of his ministers and politicians so we elected the new government, democratically at least.</p>
<p>Me: I remember when</p>
<p>Kyiv: What we have right now that is deemed fucking Nazi in Russia for some reason was democratically elected as well. And the election was not rigged this time.</p>
<p>Me: I remember when Zelenskyy first got elected and we talked about it and you were making fun of how all the choices were bad and the guy that got chosen used to be a comedian but now it‚Äôs war and he‚Äôs stepping up</p>
<p>Kyiv: Well, I mean, yeah, I still hold on to the position because economically, when he was president without war, it was not all that good</p>
<p>but now the situation we‚Äôre at right now, he‚Äôs stepping up as not only a president, he is like the major commander of the army and the resistance against the Russian invaders and he is performing even better than I couldn‚Äôt even anticipate</p>
<p>Me: I guess it‚Äôs kind of like Churchill isn‚Äôt it? People called him a good leader during war but</p>
<p>Kyiv: Yes, like he‚Äôs a war time champion, but when the peace time happens it‚Äôs just, ‚ÄòOh, man can‚Äôt wait to get rid of this guy‚Äô</p>
<p>Me: Either way, the fact Zelenskyy is out in the streets in the city actively being attacked while Putin is fucking around in a bunker is pretty funny.</p>
<p>Kyiv: Before, I was making fun of this guy, but if he goes for a second term, I‚Äôll fucking vote for him bruh.</p>
<p>Me: Ey</p>
<p>Kyiv: because like, this shit was unexpected, and I did not expect him to behave this way. And since he‚Äôs behaving this way, he‚Äôs fucking earned my respect.</p>
<p>Me: I‚Äôm sure you guys got this.</p>
<p>Kyiv: Fucking hope so, there‚Äôs no other way. Can‚Äôt believe this shit is happening. I don‚Äôt know, it was kind of a weird feeling because when I started writing again I thought back to like the poems and the stuff I was writing in high school. I thought I‚Äôd definitely write something meaningful to myself in Russian. Then I thought I would probably write something English. But at this point I feel like writing in Ukrainian would be more liberating I guess. Writing in Ukrainian nowadays seems more natural. And since this is the first time writing in Ukrainian, it feels like I‚Äôm not actually mimicking anyone, you know what I mean? Because when I write in Russian, I don‚Äôt try to mimic but it just happens that I mimic the people I‚Äôve read and same thing in English, I mimic the people that I read. But, in Ukrainian, since I haven‚Äôt read shit in Ukrainian, it doesn‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm mimicking anyone. If I had I might feel like I was mimicking someone else too</p>
<p>Me: Maybe you‚Äôre mimicking yourself</p>
<p>Kyiv: Fuck me, worst case scenario</p>
<p>What about the blog the other person suggested</p>
<p>Me:<br />
Oh, I‚Äôm still making it one of my friends is helping me finish making the website. We‚Äôre making a really minimalistic GitHub website where there‚Äôs like nothing except for the text so like it feels more isolated.</p>
<p>Kyiv: I have an archive of some really explicit pictures I would say</p>
<p>Me: of the war or of yourself</p>
<p>Kyiv: nothing explicit about myself</p>
<p>Me: I don‚Äôt know, I mean, I‚Äôm not gonna ask you to like send shit to me that you don‚Äôt want to write but there‚Äôs anything you think is interesting that maybe I could make into a project to go public.
(private conversation)
Me: So, now is your main thing just building hedgehogs?</p>
<p>Kyiv: No, it was just a one-time order because the place where our factory is in a hot zone now. So we‚Äôre basically supplying our workers who live at the factory with food. They have enough food for now. They‚Äôll be able to last for seven days at least, maybe two weeks?</p>
<p>Well, the hot zone is northeast of Kiev, where all the action happens so we‚Äôre kind of in the danger zone. At this point we‚Äôre just hoping that all the stuff that we have so far doesn‚Äôt get destroyed.</p>
<p>But, I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the main concern right now. The main concern is just that Russia doesn‚Äôt take over Kyiv and Ukraine is whole and they don‚Äôt instate their own government because that‚Äôll be a fucking disaster.
There will be the end of it. The end of everything I suppose.</p>
<p>Me: yeah that makes sense</p>
<p>what do you think are the chances of you ending up actually fighting</p>
<p>Kyiv: Well, if Kyiv is surrounded and ends up in a complete blockade, I‚Äôll end up fighting. Because right now ,like even this guy, my coworker, he volunteered on day two, I think. He went there but they didn‚Äôt really have any weapons, it was three weapons for 10 people or 2 for 10 people. It was fucking stOnks at this point. We‚Äôre now waiting for the western supplies but, for now, we have enough volunteers and drafted people who are able to fight in the army right now so we‚Äôre good. But if Kyiv ends up in a blockade or ends up in a situation when normal people have to go out in the streets because the military‚Äôs done enough, I‚Äôll probably go,</p>
<p>(private conversation)</p>
<p>Me:<br />
That‚Äôs kind of true, isn‚Äôt it</p>
<p>Kyiv: True, but at this point, if a rock gets thrown at me I‚Äôll die anyways, because I won‚Äôt be thrown rocks at by people, it will be by fucking shells and I will just be done right there</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt give a shit, bro. Because this point, I cannot even imagine myself living in any different country. I tried China. I tried Canada. And those two countries are pretty good countries to live in, you know? But I still felt out of place. Ukraine is the only country I feel like I belong to and it feels wrong not to fight for it.</p>
<p>Me: I know what you mean</p>
<p>Kyiv: Right now, I cannot do anything, but if the resistance comes to a point where it doesn‚Äôt even matter what you can do and becomes just about showing up and doing whatever you can to resist. I‚Äôll fucking do it. I don‚Äôt care.</p>
<p>Can‚Äôt imagine living under Russian rule</p>
<p>The problem with what‚Äôs going on here is the Russians were told they were doing training, but then people start fighting back so they fight too and start finding out this isn‚Äôt training, this is something else. But this is where the problems start, all the soldiers that were captured, most of them were born in 2000-2001. And they all say the same shit. They‚Äôre like, ‚ÄòOh, we don‚Äôt know where we were, we don‚Äôt know what the fuck we‚Äôre doing, we were shooting at the fucking civilian buildings as part of the training.‚Äô Here is where comes the question: Are they lying?</p>
<p>Or is this the kind of thing they‚Äôre told to say when they were captured? ‚ÄòOh, we didn‚Äôt know what the fuck or whatever. We didn‚Äôt know what the fuck we‚Äôre doing. I guess this is part of the training‚Äô</p>
<p>(private conversation)</p>
<p>Kyiv: The thing is, apart from my experience, like the entire fight, the war, all the stuff that I get is still a second-hand experience. Like yeah, I see stuff on the news. But that‚Äôs the people taking pictures, then it gets then it gets circulated by the news, and the media and their telegram channels and like the activists and all that crap and then I witness the end result. So, the experience that I get are just secondhand. My personal experience is just like my ruminations and speculation of what might happen know what might not happen. Like how the death toll that is still unknown from both sides</p>
<p>Me: I mean, if you like, don‚Äôt want me to publish it, then like, I get it, right. It‚Äôs just, I don‚Äôt know, it‚Äôs like,</p>
<p>Kyiv: not that I don‚Äôt want you to Oh, it‚Äôs more like, I‚Äôm just wondering what it‚Äôs gonna be.</p>
<p>Me: Well, it‚Äôs just, I want to make this as raw as possible. Like, I don‚Äôt want to do a really fantastical version of things. I don‚Äôt think everything needs to be completely accurate, because it‚Äôs still about perspective, right? It‚Äôs just if I didn‚Äôt talk to you every day, then I wouldn‚Äôt know anything about anything, you know? Like, really, when it comes to my motivation, that‚Äôs it. Like, the only reason I know anything about what‚Äôs happening is because I‚Äôm talking to you. If all I did was watch the news, all I would see is just people saying, ‚Äòoh, man, so like, yeah, Russia invaded Ukraine. That‚Äôs why gas prices are high.‚Äô And that doesn‚Äôt help me.</p>
<p>Kyiv: I mean, I‚Äôm just wondering if I can, like, probably gather more intel from like, the media and experiences that people have. Because if it‚Äôs just my experience, then it‚Äôs just gonna be, I guess, sort of unimportant because I‚Äôm just, I‚Äôm not in the war zone. I‚Äôm just kind of like, in the outskirts of Kiev where barely anything happens. A lot of people here have a way harder time than me.</p>
<p>Me: I don‚Äôt think you need to compete with other people about how hard the times are. I feel like whenever something bad happens, like both of us, it‚Äôs our nature for our first instinct to be ‚Äòwell, you know, this is kind of shit. But other people probably have it worse. So I don‚Äôt really get to complain.‚Äô But I‚Äôm just thinking that might not be how it always gotta be.</p>
<p>Kyiv: Oh, definitely know what you mean.</p>
<p>Me: Yeah. Like any perspective is helpful. The closest that people who are not firsthand experiencing something can get to the truth is by understanding as many perspectives as possible. So in that sense, your perspective is just as important as anyone else‚Äôs.</p>
<p>Kyiv: Yeah, but in that sense, it would make more sense to gather more perspective around</p>
<p>Me: True, but I don‚Äôt know anyone like I know you. I don‚Äôt just mean I don‚Äôt know anyone else in Ukraine like I know you. I mean I don‚Äôt know anyone anywhere like I know you. So, if I personally wrote about anyone else, it wouldn‚Äôt work.</p>
<p>Me: So, in this way, me personally, I can‚Äôt write about anyone else‚Äôs perspective. Even though having other people‚Äôs perspectives are helpful. That‚Äôs not something I‚Äôm capable of doing, because the only person I actually know is you.</p>
<p>Kyiv: That makes sense.</p>
<p>But I feel like sometimes it‚Äôs hard to comprehend my own perspective. Like, it‚Äôs easier to speculate the other person‚Äôs perspective and guess what they think, what they feel as opposed to exposing what you feel and what you see. Because a lot of the stuff that I see just goes in the backburner and you just don‚Äôt really think about it, but might make an impact for some people. It‚Äôs just the reality. I don‚Äôt really think about it that much. I‚Äôm just like oh, yeah, of course that happened because that‚Äôs the reality right now. But for other people it will be like, holy shit what the fuck</p>
<p>Sometimes, it‚Äôs hard to remember those times because it‚Äôs such a norm at this point, you know</p>
<p>It‚Äôs fucked up to say but it is a norm at this point for people to die and for people to get demolished in a fucking airstrike. And when people say like, ‚Äòwhat‚Äôs up?‚Äô I don‚Äôt say that shit. I just say like, Well, yeah, everything is as usual. But nobody knows what it entails, except for me. So, it‚Äôs hard to even describe for myself how I feel about this whole predicament.</p>
<p>(private conversation)</p>
<p>Kyiv: I really hate the word interview. Like I really hate what it implies, just interview. It feels like it‚Äôs not talking to people it‚Äôs interview, like you want to get something out of it.</p>
<p>Me: Yeah, I know you mean, it feels less personal. I don‚Äôt know, maybe I‚Äôm just emotionally traumatised from job interviews. It‚Äôs always ‚ÄòI see that you do not have any experience in this industry, so what makes you think that you can work here though?‚Äô How do I get experience if I don‚Äôt got jobs. I didn‚Äôt even have the work experience to join the Foreign Legion bro. What the fuck</p>
<p>Kyiv: I mean, what the fuck did you expect bro</p>
<p>Me: I don‚Äôt know, I thought maybe I could just like get there and die instantly and I could become fertiliser you guys might need afterwards</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt know my brain hasn‚Äôt been working. It‚Äôs like what I said earlier, nothing feels real and I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing anymore.</p>
<p>(private conversation)</p>
<p>Kyiv: There are things I need to be alive for, but, at the same time. I feel wrong for other people to die for me.</p>
<p>Me: Remember that really old text we had? Well, not that old, like a week ago where I said, this is a lose lose situation because whether you fight or don‚Äôt fight, you will betray someone. And then you said ‚Äòwell, actually, I don‚Äôt know anyone crazy enough to join.‚Äô But now it‚Äôs actually become that situation. So we just need to decide who are you more willing to betray?</p>
<p>Kyiv: I feel like when I‚Äôm fighting, I‚Äôm betraying myself</p>
<p>Me: Are you willing to betray yourself?</p>
<p>Kyiv: For some reason, to me, betraying myself is not as dire or devastating as betraying _______. I don‚Äôt know how to explain it. But I feel like like my responsibility before _______ overweighs my responsibility for myself and despite me willing to fight, I cannot even fathom the idea of _______ suffering as a result of me dying. Even though it sounds kind of selfish, in a way, because it sounds like I‚Äôm just using an excuse for not fighting. But to be honest, I wanted to fucking die a long time before I even comprehended this fucking idea. In the end, I never cared about dying, but I really I really care about _______, and I wouldn‚Äôt really want _________________.</p>
<p>But to be honest, if it was not for _______. I would join on the fucking 24th of February. If anyone else wanted to stop me, I wouldn‚Äôt care.</p>
<p>(private conversation)</p>
<p>Me: Yeah, this is your internal journey. This is your story. Your story is in the fucking making. don‚Äôt know, we write a lot of stories, you know. We always think fuck, the internal journey here is not good, the external journey here is not good. But how many people live and die with an actual journey of their own. Your journey here means something to you so it might mean something to other people. This is the only kind of memoir that makes sense. If I ever write one, it‚Äôs just gonna be about me applying to jobs and getting rejected for 10 years and then dying in a ditch. That‚Äôs not gonna help people but yours might.</p>
<p>Kyiv: Your memoir is gonna be about fishing with your granddad then planting fucking tomatoes in the shade that actually fucking grows. That‚Äôll be fucking impressive.</p>
<p>Me: How he planted tomatoes in the gravel, I don‚Äôt even know bruh</p>
<p>Kyiv: Nobody even knew it was possible. Honestly, though, like, do you think there‚Äôs any reason to even post this shit? Like if I were to write a memoir, should I even share it with anyone?</p>
<p>Me: I think you should. I think this is important. I‚Äôve written so much bullshit that doesn‚Äôt do anything except just be mildly entertaining like _________. But the most famous writers die really young and they live really troubled lives. But I think there‚Äôs no way to be good at writing without going through those experiences. Like for a writer, being depressed and paranoid for 20 years and then killing yourself at the age of 22 is completely normal. But that‚Äôs just,</p>
<p>Kyiv: yeah, I know, I read Bukowski.
And because he says shit like, I was lucky enough to have a shit life.</p>
<p>Me: It‚Äôs not being a writer that causes it.</p>
<p>Kyiv: Exactly, you can‚Äôt be good at writing without those things. So it‚Äôs not writing causes the experiences. It‚Äôs just the experiences.</p>
<p>But this is barely a shit situation. I‚Äôm here in the countryside, smoking shisha, having decent internet and warm and clothed. I have food to eat. Like I have nothing to complain about except for my inner struggles about this fuckin external situation.</p>
<p>Me: internal struggles out the most important thing</p>
<p>Kyiv: I just feel wrong about not being out there with the other guys just fighting for the freedom. It‚Äôs like the Donbass conflict, fucking Putin and Poroshenko and whoever the fuck decided that shit, I didn‚Äôt want to die in that conflict. But this time, this time is actually the Patriotic War. This is the war for independence. This is the war for freedom. This is the war that decides the future of this nation. And I didn‚Äôt think I would even say this out loud, but right now it feels like I am a patriot because I want to die for this country. But the only thing that is stopping me is just shitty fucking guilt</p>
<p>(private conversation)</p>
<p>Kyiv: Aye bro, your brother from another mother. Jokes aside, I really consider people that are not blood related my family as well and you‚Äôre part of that family.</p>
<p>And I‚Äôm not just like saying that lightly, like I really mean it. Because I really do consider us family because you can just come here anytime you want. I mean I don‚Äôt mean now, like when things blow over, just come here. And if ______ doesn‚Äôt block me or just fucking deport me again, I‚Äôll come to ________</p>
<p>Me: I don‚Äôt know if what I‚Äôm fucking saying makes any sense anymore, but I‚Äôve been trying to make it as a fucking writer for so long and pushing hard in personal ambitions and that‚Äôs been a completely futile endeavour. But when we were in high school, we talked about what duty a person has. I remember this conversation well because you talked to T______ about it. Like if your country told you to kill civilians, would you do it? And T______ said he probably would. Then we had a discussion about that where we disagreed. You said you feel that loyalty is mostly about loyalty to our friends and family. But I argued that loyalty is mostly about being loyal to a cause or a personal ambition or something like that, but I think you were right the whole time.</p>
<p>Kyiv: I mean, I don‚Äôt really remember that conversation but I remember B______ and T_____‚Äôs argument about bombing civilians.</p>
<p>Yeah, like I guess loyalty to family and friends is the only thing we have since being loyal to cause could imply anything, it might imply any losses, any victories, but in the end, all you have is cause itself. And what cost does it come at? The victory of a cause. The victory of an idea. This is basically ideology, like do you die for your cause or do you die for your family and friends? Or directly related to you directly responsible for you and you‚Äôre directly responsible for them? Or do you die for the cause that is implied upon you by the government or the society or yourself?</p>
<p>I feel like family and friends like the only way to go. Because I remember there was another conversation about if your friend committed a crime or your family member committed a crime, would you give them in to the police? And obviously the answer is no because that‚Äôs your family I‚Äôm gonna give it away. I don‚Äôt really give a shit about the fucking law system because it‚Äôs fucking rigged, like I don‚Äôt care about justice when it comes to my family because I would just want to make my family out of that fucking predicament, I can‚Äôt care about fucking justice at this point</p>
<p>(private conversation)</p>
<p>Kyiv: Thanks man, it really means a lot. Like, it does sound cringe when people say ‚Äòit really means a lot to me‚Äô but like I really do mean it because for a long time you‚Äôve already been part of my family so definitely I don‚Äôt really perceive you as a friend anymore, it‚Äôs just like, you know, well, it‚Äôs just [my name]</p>
<p>Me: Yeah, I can‚Äôt believe I blocked you on Discord so many times. I also can‚Äôt believe the biggest problem I had these last few weeks haemorrhoids. I mean I gotta admit they‚Äôre pretty painful and I still have them, like they‚Äôre still really hurting right now but compared to everything else is not that bad.</p>
<p>What do you think is more painful, having haemorrhoids or your country being invaded?</p>
<p>Kyiv: Definitely haemorrhoids, it‚Äôs a personal attack just to you.</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt know, bro. I just want to believe that maybe in a year from now, maybe even less than that, you‚Äôll just come here and we‚Äôll smoke shisha and we‚Äôll just watch some old cartoons just like nothing has ever even fucking occurred here. That‚Äôll be a really fucking dope feeling.</p>
<p>As for your writing carrier, I feel like you just have to give it time because you have to have experience to write something meaningful, right?</p>
<p>Me: I don‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt really</p>
<p>Kyiv: Like I know Stephen King just shits out a novel every fucking three weeks but I mean that‚Äôs Stephen King, bro</p>
<p>Me: I don‚Äôt want you to fucking give a shit about my writing career right now. It‚Äôs not really the time. I think right now, when we think about writing, we should think about your memoir</p>
<p>Kyiv: My memoir will come in a while. I‚Äôll keep writing it but I hope to finish it after the war ends and hopefully the odds are in our favour because if the odds are not in our favour I will not finish my memoir</p>
<p>Fucking hate talking about this petty shit like how my country just got bombarded. Let‚Äôs just talk about some more meaningful shit</p>
<p>Me: Let‚Äôs talk about that one part from Avatar.</p>
<p>Kyiv: That‚Äôs rough buddy</p>
<p>Me: I liked the part where they had the beach episode. Man, Ty Lee was such a good character, she didn‚Äôt know what she was doing she was just having fun.</p>
<p>Remember when she was like ‚Äòhaha, isn‚Äôt it funny how like everyone here just comes up and talks to me‚Äô and Azula was like ‚Äòthat‚Äôs because you‚Äôre a whore‚Äô then she starts crying and I was like ‚Äòwait a sec‚Äô</p>
<p>Kyiv: Just because you‚Äôre not a whore, you don‚Äôt have to make fun of other whores</p>
<p>Me: What is going on? Such a good show.</p>

<p>[15:14] Me: one of the discord servers im in descended into a my enemy of my enemy situation</p>
<p>[15:14] Me: they used to not care but now that they think nato is on ukraine‚Äôs side theyre supporting russia</p>
<p>[15:14] Me: but no one is really practically on ukraines side are they</p>
<p>[15:14] Me: just another argument for people to have</p>
<p>[15:15] Me: remember that turkish grad student</p>
<p>[15:15] Me: we met at the shisha place in beijing</p>
<p>[15:15] Me: how he talked about the great game</p>
<p>[15:15] Me: i keep thinking about what he said</p>
<p>[22:22] Kyiv: well yeah</p>
<p>[22:22] Kyiv: it‚Äôs obvious other countries are helping us not because they want us to win but because they want russia to lose</p>
<p>[22:23] Kyiv: putin fucked up and everyone took this opportunity to fuck him in the ass</p>
<p>[22:23] Kyiv: wasn‚Äôt that grad student from hungary?</p>
<p>[22:26] Me: i dont remember very well</p>
<p>[22:27] Kyiv: was it the same guy who could speak perfect mandarin with 3 different accents?</p>
<p>[22:32] Me: it was the guy who did like palm reading or something</p>
<p>[22:32] Me: and read the palm of the magician who couldnt do magic and had pants below his ass</p>
<p>[22:33] Kyiv: shit</p>
<p>[22:33] Kyiv: i don‚Äôt remember</p>
<p>[22:37] Me: i like how we rememebr different details about probably the same person</p>
<p>[22:37] Me: but now that i think about it</p>
<p>[22:37] Me: i think he was hungarian</p>
<p>[22:37] Me: he talked about lao zi right</p>
<p>[22:37] Kyiv: i think so</p>
<p>[22:37] Kyiv: we only met him once</p>
<p>[22:37] Me: yea</p>
<p>[22:37] Kyiv: he was white</p>
<p>[22:37] Kyiv: and fat</p>
<p>[22:37] Me: yea</p>
<p>[22:37] Me: ok same guy</p>
<p>[22:37] Kyiv: and probably had a beard</p>
<p>[22:37] Kyiv: although im not sure</p>
<p>[22:38] Kyiv: i don‚Äôt remember the palm reading bit</p>
<p>[22:39] Me: he didnt read our palms</p>
<p>[22:39] Me: only the magicians one</p>
<p>[22:40] Kyiv: was it that annoying russian magician</p>
<p>[22:43] Me: yea</p>
<p>[22:44] Kyiv: fuck that guy</p>
<p>[22:44] Kyiv: i think his name was dmitriy</p>
<p>[22:44] Kyiv: or was it max</p>
<p>[22:44] Kyiv: shit i dont remember</p>
<p>[22:44] Kyiv: i definitely remember his friend‚Äôs name</p>
<p>[22:44] Kyiv: yaroslav</p>
<p>[22:45] Me: was that the guy who said</p>
<p>[22:45] Me: your balls are empty</p>
<p>[22:45] Kyiv: yeah that‚Äôs yaroslav</p>
<p>[22:45] Kyiv: i met him at least 5 times outside of our shisha place</p>
<p>[22:45] Kyiv: at different shisha places</p>
<p>[22:46] Kyiv: cuz every time i went somewhere and got a spontaneous urge to smoke shisha</p>
<p>[22:47] Kyiv: he was already at the closest shisha place with his pals</p>
<p>[22:47] Kyiv: i don‚Äôt even know what he did for a living tbh</p>
<p>[22:48] Kyiv: i think he was like 25 but he looked and sounded 15</p>
<p>[22:52] Me: fuck</p>
<p>[22:52] Me: like that guy with the ipad</p>
<p>[22:52] Me: professional lung cancer connoisseur</p>
<p>[22:56] Kyiv: simpler times</p>
<p>[22:57] Kyiv:</p>
<p>631.jpg</p>
<p>[23:06] Me: fuck</p>
<p>[23:06] Me: really was simpler times</p>
<p>[23:06] Me: i was wondering something</p>
<p>[23:07] Me: so on the news here</p>
<p>[23:07] Me: well not really the news</p>
<p>[23:07] Me: just in general</p>
<p>[23:07] Me: when people talk about the war</p>
<p>[23:07] Me: they always say the only enemy is putin but normal russians are victims and it looks like they have a lot of sympathy for them</p>
<p>[23:07] Me: but like</p>
<p>[23:08] Me: obviously this doesn‚Äôt happen when theyre mad at other countries it‚Äôs just shit we got to kill everyone</p>
<p>[23:08] Me: do you think it‚Äôs just because like</p>
<p>[23:08] Me: russians are white</p>
<p>[23:08] Me: christians i guess</p>
<p>[23:08] Me: or is it just putin‚Äôs reputation as a person</p>
<p>[23:09] Kyiv: it might be partially because of religion</p>
<p>[23:09] Kyiv: and putin being a dictator so people are more inclined to blame everything on him</p>
<p>[23:09] Me: i dont know i just remember researching sinophobia for my paper last year</p>
<p>[23:10] Me: and all the articles are just</p>
<p>[23:10] Me: the only solution is nuking everyone on china</p>
<p>[23:10] Me: even though the problem was just chinese tech companies are growing faster</p>
<p>[23:10] Me: and it‚Äôs like</p>
<p>[23:10] Me: is it just about race and religion</p>
<p>[23:10] Me: i feel like there‚Äôs more to it</p>
<p>[23:10] Me: same thing with all the middle eastern coutnries</p>
<p>[23:12] Me: because based on what i‚Äôve heard from you</p>
<p>[23:12] Me: ukrainians just dont like russians in general</p>
<p>[23:13] Kyiv: i think it all has a lot to do with how media that‚Äôs influenced by politicians who are influenced by business people are pinning everything not on individuals who are posing a threat but it‚Äôs on the entire nation. you never hear people mention those ceo‚Äôs and companies, they always say china</p>
<p>[23:13] Kyiv: and as practice shows people are stupid</p>
<p>[23:16] Kyiv: because it‚Äôs easy to a find a way to hate a group of people as every group has social layers that could be picked on for being different from yours. the first layer could be race, the next could be religion, then nation, and you can keep going indefinitely.</p>
<p>[23:17] Kyiv: and i feel like in case with china, it‚Äôs a mix of layers</p>
<p>[23:17] Kyiv: it‚Äôs race</p>
<p>[23:17] Kyiv: it‚Äôs communism</p>
<p>[23:18] Kyiv: perhaps the foreign financial policies that threaten the west and are labelled as ‚Äúbad‚Äù but in reality are only bad for the west</p>
<p>[23:19] Me: i feel like the paper i wrote might have been too general</p>
<p>[23:19] Me: because one of the main points of the essay</p>
<p>[23:20] Me: was how everyone from the same race/country gets referred to when the media talks about something they dont like from somewhere else</p>
<p>[23:20] Me: but it‚Äôs different this time</p>
<p>[23:20] Me: no one here says man russians fucking suck</p>
<p>[23:20] Me: it‚Äôs just oh man putin personally</p>
<p>[23:20] Me: so i feel like there‚Äôs more nuance to it than my paper suggested</p>
<p>[23:21] Me: and it only applies to some places with the right layers like you said</p>
<p>[23:22] Kyiv: that‚Äôs interesting</p>
<p>[23:22] Kyiv: i‚Äôve never thought about it</p>
<p>[23:23] Me: i didn‚Äôt really think about it until today</p>
<p>[23:23] Me: i saw an article talking about how ukrainains refugees are talked about different than arabic refugees</p>
<p>[23:23] Me: with one newscaster straight up saying they‚Äôre white</p>
<p>[23:24] Me: and i was reading comments about how only putin is the enemy and everyone in russian is just a victim</p>
<p>[23:24] Me: and i realised my theory in my paper was completely wrong</p>
<p>[23:24] Kyiv: you could write another paper with a new perspective</p>
<p>[23:24] Me: i‚Äôm thinking about it</p>
<p>[23:24] Me: hard to do these days</p>
<p>[23:25] Me: think i‚Äôll just collect sources and go about it slowly as i go</p>
<p>[23:27] Me: unlike before i dont have resources like</p>
<p>[23:27] Me: the ability to talk to a professor</p>
<p>[23:27] Me: so it‚Äôs hard to get an essay going</p>
<p>[23:27] Me: even harder to get it published</p>
<p>[23:28] Kyiv: as for ukrainian refugees. i thought about it. i think it has a lot to do with christian slavs fleeing to their neighbouring christian slavs. maybe if arabs fled to the neighboring arabs it wouldn‚Äôt be such a problem.</p>
<p>[23:29] Me: i guess that‚Äôs true</p>
<p>[23:29] Me: it‚Äôs just the first two layers</p>
<p>[23:29] Me: race and religion</p>
<p>[23:29] Me: being met</p>
<p>[23:29] Kyiv: ye</p>
<p>[23:31] Me: man</p>
<p>[23:31] Me: being not white is just</p>
<p>[23:31] Me: you‚Äôre just fucked by default</p>
<p>[23:31] Me: but now</p>
<p>[23:31] Me: even some white people are fucked</p>
<p>[23:33] Kyiv: yeah. i wish i was black</p>
<p>[23:33] Me: imagine being black in ukraine right now</p>
<p>[23:34] Kyiv: at least i could blame white ppl</p>
<p>[23:34] Me: you can still blame white people</p>
<p>[23:35] Kyiv: gonna blame russians</p>
<p>[23:35] Me: shit</p>
<p>[23:36] Kyiv: don‚Äôt even know how to feel about it all</p>
<p>[23:37] Kyiv: on the one hand putin brainwashed the majority of his population and surrounded himself with oligarchs so it‚Äôs hard to get rid of him and people aren‚Äôt to blame</p>
<p>[23:38] Kyiv: on the other hand putin wouldn‚Äôt exist without the russian people and it is not putin who is carrying out the orders to bomb and shoot civilians</p>
<p>[23:38] Kyiv: it kind of reminds me of german civilians who knew about holocaust and did nothing to stop it</p>
<p>[23:39] Me: i guess that makes sense</p>
<p>[23:40] Me: i guess there‚Äôs no such thing as</p>
<p>[23:40] Me: a correct answer to who exact is to blame</p>
<p>[23:40] Me: people just decide that based on how much sympathy they have for different groups of people</p>
<p>[23:40] Me: which i suppose go back to the layers like you mentioned previously</p>
<p>[23:42] Kyiv: makes sense</p>
