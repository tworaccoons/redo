<p>[20:30] Me: have you decided what you‚Äôre going to do</p>
<p>[20:30] Me: are you staying in ukraine or leaving</p>
<p>[21:05] Kyiv: the borders are going to be closed</p>
<p>[21:05] Kyiv: probably gonna go to the western ukraine if shit really hits the fan</p>
<p>[21:05] Kyiv: just hoping for a diplomatic resolution</p>
<p>[21:05] Kyiv: but i think putin will get some more land first</p>
<p>[21:39] Me: i feel like</p>
<p>[21:39] Me: this just a play</p>
<p>[21:39] Me: so ukraine will have to give them the land held by separatists</p>
<p>[21:39] Me: but if it gets worse</p>
<p>[21:39] Me: you‚Äôre pretty fucked</p>
<p>[21:39] Kyiv: yes</p>
<p>[21:40] Me: if it‚Äôs actual open war you can‚Äôt join because it‚Äôs completely futile</p>
<p>[21:40] Me: but you also can‚Äôt not join</p>
<p>[21:40] Me: because that‚Äôs absolute betrayal of everyone</p>
<p>[21:41] Kyiv: that‚Äôs not betrayal. why should anyone be forced to fight the wars that a few rarts started. they may go ahead resolve the issue with a duel. that would be top tier entertainment</p>
<p>[21:42] Me: it‚Äôs only a betrayal of the people you know who actually joined</p>
<p>[21:42] Kyiv: i don‚Äôt even know anyone crazy enough to join</p>
<p>[21:43] Kyiv: everyone i know says they‚Äôre either gonna get the fuck out of here or stay home and watch
netflix</p>

<p>[17:40] Me: is kyiv going to fall at this rate</p>
<p>[17:40] Me: if you‚Äôre planning on going elsewhere, might as well be earlier as opposed to later</p>

<p>[11:00] Me: It‚Äôs only the two, right</p>

<p>[00:04] Kyiv: yes</p>
<p>[00:04] Me: still at your apartment?</p>
<p>[00:05] Kyiv: no. im with my parents at our country place. it‚Äôs not super far away from all the action but it‚Äôs safer than my apartment</p>
<p>[00:06] Me: if you intend to leave ukraine</p>
<p>[00:06] Me: i can probably start helping you with a canadian visa</p>

<p>[00:08] Kyiv: can‚Äôt let these fucking russians have what they want</p>
<p>[00:09] Me: last resort</p>
<p>[00:10] Kyiv: honestly, dying seems like a better option</p>
<p>[00:10] Kyiv: wouldn‚Äôt want to be russian under any circumstance</p>
<p>[00:10] Kyiv: might be last chance to die ukrainian</p>
<p>[00:12] Kyiv: surprisingly, the ukrainian defences are doing a really good job</p>
<p>[00:15] Me: this is</p>
<p>[00:15] Me: a situation ukraine already got fucked in</p>
<p>[00:15] Me: but what do you think</p>
<p>[00:15] Me: are the chances ukraine remains a country once violence is over</p>
<p>[00:16] Kyiv: i really hope so</p>
<p>[00:16] Kyiv: and i think there‚Äôs still hope</p>
<p>[00:16] Kyiv: we will definitely lose some land</p>
<p>[00:17] Kyiv: but as long as we have kiev</p>
<p>[00:17] Kyiv: and the president that i thought was a joke turned out to be a competent leader during these fucked up times</p>
<p>[00:17] Me: i was watching zelenskyy videos</p>
<p>[00:17] Me: no clue what he‚Äôs saying</p>
<p>[00:17] Me: but the fact he‚Äôs still in kyiv is pretty good</p>
<p>[00:18] Me: man</p>
<p>[00:18] Kyiv: yeah</p>
<p>[00:18] Me: it‚Äôs so fucky</p>
<p>[00:18] Me: reading my other discord channels</p>
<p>[00:18] Me: people talking about unbalance in the new total war</p>
<p>[00:18] Me: like it‚Äôs the biggest problem</p>
<p>[00:18] Me: when people i know are in warzones</p>
<p>[00:18] Me: kind of surreal</p>
<p>[00:18] Kyiv: yeah. i know</p>
<p>[00:18] Kyiv: my mom said this morning</p>
<p>[00:19] Kyiv: that only now she understands how good everything really was before</p>
<p>[00:20] Kyiv: and our cat shitting in the bathtub being our biggest problem kinda feels unreal now</p>
<p>[00:21] Kyiv: man</p>
<p>[00:22] Kyiv: nobody thought putin was insane enough to start a full scale invasion</p>
<p>[00:22] Kyiv: everyone thought he was bluffing</p>
<p>[00:23] Me: does russia even have allies in this</p>
<p>[00:35] Kyiv: belarus</p>
<p>[00:36] Kyiv: and putin was hoping for kazakhstan to send their forces but they refused</p>
<p>[00:36] Me: isn‚Äôt belarus just</p>
<p>[00:37] Me: letting putin go through their territory</p>
<p>[00:37] Me: or are they supporting them in any material way as well</p>
<p>[00:37] Kyiv: we don‚Äôt know</p>
<p>[00:38] Kyiv: but the fact that the entire northern border is with belarus grants access to kiev and western regions</p>
<p>[00:38] Kyiv: all shit we have near kiev right now</p>
<p>[00:38] Kyiv: came from belarus</p>
<p>[00:39] Me: do you think they could have stopped russia</p>
<p>[00:39] Me: or would they have just gone through anyway</p>
<p>[00:39] Kyiv: they had no intention to stop anyone. lukashenko is putin‚Äôs fuck buddy</p>
<p>[00:41] Me: that makes sense</p>
<p>[00:41] Me: i‚Äôm still thinking about</p>
<p>[00:41] Me: which steps could have been preventable</p>
<p>[00:41] Me: but i guess it doesn‚Äôt matter to anymore</p>
<p>[00:42] Kyiv: it couldn‚Äôt be prevented. a year ago one russian politician slipped that on march of next year we‚Äôll take kiev in 3 days</p>
<p>[00:43] Kyiv: so whatever the fuck is happening right now</p>
<p>[00:43] Kyiv: was planned a long time ago</p>
<p>[00:45] Me: can‚Äôt believe russia is sacrificing its relationship with every country to invade ukraine</p>
<p>[00:48] Kyiv: i‚Äôve been trying to understand why he‚Äôs doing this but i still don‚Äôt understand how all these costs and losses could possibly justify themselves.</p>
<p>[00:49] Kyiv: russia‚Äôs economy is going to collapse</p>
<p>[00:49] Kyiv: most diplomatic and financial relationships with russia will be cut</p>
<p>[00:50] Kyiv: all this for a plot of land full of people who will keep fighting even if the war is already
lost</p>
<p>[00:51] Kyiv: even the british minister is saying that everything that‚Äôs happening is illogical and putin has probably gone insane</p>
<p>[00:52] Me: is this just some</p>
<p>[00:52] Me: bullshit power trip</p>
<p>[00:52] Me: where he‚Äôs just too upset ukraine is not russia</p>
<p>[00:53] Me: i really wonder what the public in russia thinks</p>
<p>[00:53] Me: can‚Äôt imagine anyone thinking this is helpful to them</p>
<p>[00:55] Kyiv: old retards who actually voted for putin still support him. they believe the russian news even when it‚Äôs complete bullshit. a lot of people appear to be brainwashed</p>
<p>[00:56] Kyiv: young people are out in the streets, protesting against the war</p>
<p>[00:56] Kyiv: almost 2000 were already arrested</p>
<p>[00:57] Kyiv: i don‚Äôt know what putin was hoping for but he might have dug up his own grave.</p>
<p>[07:09] Kyiv: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRc9htfOLiw" class="uri">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRc9htfOLiw</a></p>

<p>[12:02] Me: being like</p>
<p>[12:02] Me: ilya do you want to play stardew valley</p>
<p>[12:02] Me: feels like a really long time ago</p>
<p>[12:02] Me: but it was actually less than a month wasn‚Äôt it</p>
<p>[12:38] Kyiv: fucking putin</p>
<p>[12:38] Kyiv: penis head</p>
<p>[13:11] Me: this is making me wonder about myself</p>
<p>[13:11] Me: if ____ gets invaded, how hard would i work</p>
<p>[13:11] Me: i think in the end</p>
<p>[13:11] Me: all i can do is align with people who look like me</p>
<p>[13:15] Kyiv: in the end, it‚Äôs about how you feel toward your nation. some people have no problem leaving their homeland without looking back even for a split second, others can‚Äôt leave knowing their home is being invaded. both have justifiable reasons</p>
<p>[13:15] Kyiv: i can see myself being both</p>
<p>[13:15] Kyiv: but this time i choose to stay</p>
<p>[13:16] Kyiv: artillery strike in 10min</p>
<p>[13:16] Kyiv: ttyl</p>
<p>[14:01] Me: good luck</p>

<p>[01:01] Me: but it might be good to get perspective out there</p>
<p>[01:01] Me: since all the news is created by people who aren‚Äôt even there</p>
<p>[01:01] Kyiv: i scan the local news, bbc, cnn, nyt, and the russian news</p>
<p>[01:02] Kyiv: russians are just living in a parallel universe</p>
<p>[01:02] Kyiv: they say they dont have any casualties</p>
<p>[01:02] Kyiv: and they are successfully liberating ukrainians from the nazi rule</p>
<p>[01:03] Kyiv: in the meantime more than 20k civilians took arms to defend against russians</p>

<p>[01:05] Me: all the civilians taking up arms and making homemade explosives to put up a futile fight</p>
<p>[01:05] Me: is just like the resistance against the japanese</p>
<p>[01:05] Me: but everyone still feels disconnected</p>
<p>[01:06] Me: to people forget about history too quickly or do people just not care about anythng happening directly to them</p>
<p>[01:06] Kyiv: either</p>
<p>[01:09] Kyiv: just got an update in the civilan force</p>
<p>[01:09] Kyiv: 37k in kiev alone</p>

<p>[14:25] Kyiv: man</p>
<p>[14:26] Kyiv: so far ukraine is able to defend the flanks</p>
<p>[14:27] Kyiv: and if the west is able to keep up its promises with weapons supply and russia doesn‚Äôt get any support we might have a chance</p>
<p>[14:27] Me: holy shit</p>
<p>[14:27] Kyiv: things can go sideways any time</p>
<p>[14:27] Me: china‚Äôs state banks all pulled out of russia</p>
<p>[14:28] Me: i dont think a few extra hobos from belarus is going to make a difference</p>
<p>[14:28] Kyiv: they might make an impact since they are walking distance from kyiv</p>
<p>[14:28] Kyiv: and if we lose kyiv</p>
<p>[14:28] Kyiv: it‚Äôs gg</p>
<p>[14:29] Kyiv: but i think lukashenko pussied out of it</p>
<p>[14:29] Kyiv: and balarusians don‚Äôt wanna fight ukrainians</p>
<p>[14:29] Me: does russia even need to worry about</p>

<p>[14:29] Me: aren‚Äôt they all based in eastern ukraine now</p>
<p>[14:29] Me: and going to kyiv from there</p>
<p>[14:30] Kyiv: it‚Äôs still a long way from the eastern front. i think they banked on the troops in the north to take kyiv in no time</p>
<p>[14:30] Kyiv: but that didn‚Äôt go according to plan</p>
<p>[14:30] Kyiv: so far</p>
<p>[14:30] Kyiv: there is still a threat from north</p>
<p>[14:30] Kyiv: and they are taking a lot of land from the south as well</p>
<p>[14:31] Me: fuck</p>
<p>[14:31] Me: can‚Äôt wait for sabaton to write a song about this</p>

<p>[14:32] Kyiv: i think if there was no great war album i‚Äôd actually be able to enjoy it</p>
<p>[14:33] Me: yea i know what you mean</p>
<p>[14:33] Me: every part of it was a masterpiece</p>
<p>[14:33] Kyiv: it might be that their greatest album is great war and everything they release now is just going to be compared to it</p>
<p>[14:33] Me: man</p>
<p>[14:33] Me: honestly can‚Äôt believe kyiv still exists</p>
<p>[14:33] Kyiv: same</p>

<p>[14:36] Me: i feel like i haven‚Äôt been living in different reality for so long</p>

<p>[14:43] Kyiv: russians‚Äô kadirov troops which are basically muslim extremists took over the chernobyl and zaporozhian nuclear power plants</p>
<p>[14:44] Kyiv: can‚Äôt predict anything when those fgts are involved</p>
<p>[14:44] Kyiv: the pills are all out of stock</p>
<p>[14:45] Me: fuck</p>
<p>[14:47] Me: oh it‚Äôs chechens</p>
<p>[14:47] Me: i can see that being worrying</p>
<p>[14:48] Kyiv: the chechens that fled the chechen wars in russia are now fighting on our side now</p>
<p>[14:49] Kyiv: that‚Äôs a good thing since they are well trained and have personal hatred toward russian chechens</p>
<p>[14:51] Kyiv: NATO‚Äôs inability to help out with troops and securing ukraine‚Äôs airspace is kinda frustrating but i guess we‚Äôll just have to do with what we have</p>
<p>[14:51] Kyiv: the promised jets are taking a while tho</p>
<p>[14:51] Me: i mean it‚Äôs like</p>
<p>[14:51] Me: does nato really want to be a friend of ukraine</p>
<p>[14:52] Me: or do they just want russia to take as many losses as possible</p>
<p>[14:52] Me: without costing them anything</p>
<p>[14:52] Kyiv: in my opinion</p>
<p>[14:52] Kyiv: nato just wants russia to lose</p>
<p>[14:52] Kyiv: but they don‚Äôt want an open conflict with them</p>
<p>[14:52] Kyiv: cuz it would essentially mean ww3</p>
<p>[14:53] Kyiv: so they are just supplying us with weapons</p>
<p>[14:53] Kyiv: disregarding the losses we might endure</p>
<p>[14:54] Kyiv: im at the same time grateful and displeased</p>
<p>[14:55] Kyiv: what are you doing rn</p>
