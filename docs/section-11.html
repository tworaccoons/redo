<h2>3/3</h2>
<p>[14:25] Kyiv: man</p>
<p>[14:26] Kyiv: so far ukraine is able to defend the flanks</p>
<p>[14:27] Kyiv: and if the west is able to keep up its promises with weapons supply and russia doesn’t get any support we might have a chance</p>
<p>[14:27] Me: holy shit</p>
<p>[14:27] Kyiv: things can go sideways any time</p>
<p>[14:27] Me: china’s state banks all pulled out of russia</p>
<p>[14:28] Me: i dont think a few extra hobos from belarus is going to make a difference</p>
<p>[14:28] Kyiv: they might make an impact since they are walking distance from kyiv</p>
<p>[14:28] Kyiv: and if we lose kyiv</p>
<p>[14:28] Kyiv: it’s gg</p>
<p>[14:29] Kyiv: but i think lukashenko pussied out of it</p>
<p>[14:29] Kyiv: and balarusians don’t wanna fight ukrainians</p>
<p>[14:29] Me: does russia even need to worry about</p>
<p>[14:29] Me: supply lines or whatever</p>
<p>[14:29] Me: aren’t they all based in eastern ukraine now</p>
<p>[14:29] Me: and going to kyiv from there</p>
<p>[14:30] Kyiv: it’s still a long way from the eastern front. i think they banked on the troops in the north to take kyiv in no time</p>
<p>[14:30] Kyiv: but that didn’t go according to plan</p>
<p>[14:30] Kyiv: so far</p>
<p>[14:30] Kyiv: there is still a threat from north</p>
<p>[14:30] Kyiv: and they are taking a lot of land from the south as well</p>
<p>[14:31] Me: fuck</p>
<p>[14:31] Me: can’t wait for sabaton to write a song about this</p>
<p>[14:31] Kyiv: listened to the new sabaton new album yesterday</p>
<p>[14:31] Kyiv: idk bro</p>
<p>[14:31] Kyiv: didn’t really like it</p>
<p>[14:32] Kyiv: i think if there was no great war album i’d actually be able to enjoy it</p>
<p>[14:33] Me: yea i know what you mean</p>
<p>[14:33] Me: every part of it was a masterpiece</p>
<p>[14:33] Kyiv: it might be that their greatest album is great war and everything they release now is just going to be compared to it</p>
<p>[14:33] Me: man</p>
<p>[14:33] Me: honestly can’t believe kyiv still exists</p>
<p>[14:33] Kyiv: same</p>
<p>[14:34] Kyiv: if we can hold for one more week</p>
<p>[14:34] Kyiv: we’ll know if ukraine has a chance or not</p>
<p>[14:35] Kyiv: if we win</p>
<p>[14:35] Kyiv: i don’t even fucking know bro</p>
<p>[14:35] Kyiv: it’s like</p>
<p>[14:35] Kyiv: everything that didn’t make sense would make even less sense</p>
<p>[14:36] Me: i feel like i haven’t been living in different reality for so long</p>
<p>[14:36] Me: real life is just absolute insanity</p>
<p>[14:36] Me: everything is a paradox</p>
<p>[14:36] Me: gotta fucking</p>
<p>[14:36] Me: retreat back into my corner of perplexity bruh</p>
<p>[14:37] Kyiv: mr gibson would approve</p>
<p>[14:37] Kyiv: can’t fucking believe this shit is happening</p>
<p>[14:38] Kyiv: biden warned everyone that the attack was imminent but people just couldn;t fathom this course of events</p>
<p>[14:38] Kyiv: it just defied any logic</p>
<p>[14:38] Kyiv: and then all of a sudden it became reality</p>
<p>[14:38] Kyiv: and everyone was like</p>
<p>[14:38] Kyiv: shenme</p>
<p>[14:40] Me: yea man</p>
<p>[14:40] Me: russians came</p>
<p>[14:40] Me: and ukrainians were like</p>
<p>[14:40] Me: 干吗</p>
<p>[14:40] Kyiv: the nuclear threat is kinda fucked tho</p>
<p>[14:41] Kyiv: can’t even get iodine pills anywhere</p>
<p>[14:41] Me: man</p>
<p>[14:42] Me: aren’t private pharm companies starting to supply them</p>
<p>[14:43] Kyiv: russians’ kadirov troops which are basically muslim extremists took over the chernobyl and zaporozhian nuclear power plants</p>
<p>[14:44] Kyiv: can’t predict anything when those fgts are involved</p>
<p>[14:44] Kyiv: the pills are all out of stock</p>
<p>[14:45] Me: fuck</p>
<p>[14:47] Me: oh it’s chechens</p>
<p>[14:47] Me: i can see that being worrying</p>
<p>[14:48] Kyiv: the chechens that fled the chechen wars in russia are now fighting on our side now</p>
<p>[14:49] Kyiv: that’s a good thing since they are well trained and have personal hatred toward russian chechens</p>
<p>[14:51] Kyiv: NATO’s inability to help out with troops and securing ukraine’s airspace is kinda frustrating but i guess we’ll just have to do with what we have</p>
<p>[14:51] Kyiv: the promised jets are taking a while tho</p>
<p>[14:51] Me: i mean it’s like</p>
<p>[14:51] Me: does nato really want to be a friend of ukraine</p>
<p>[14:52] Me: or do they just want russia to take as many losses as possible</p>
<p>[14:52] Me: without costing them anything</p>
<p>[14:52] Kyiv: in my opinion</p>
<p>[14:52] Kyiv: nato just wants russia to lose</p>
<p>[14:52] Kyiv: but they don’t want an open conflict with them</p>
<p>[14:52] Kyiv: cuz it would essentially mean ww3</p>
<p>[14:53] Kyiv: so they are just supplying us with weapons</p>
<p>[14:53] Kyiv: disregarding the losses we might endure</p>
<p>[14:54] Kyiv: im at the same time grateful and displeased</p>
<p>[14:55] Kyiv: what are you doing rn</p>
<p>[14:55] Me: being depressed</p>
<p>[14:55] Kyiv: good</p>
