[00:51] Kyiv: so they could be tied to the lampposts for hours [00:52] Me: classic manhunters [00:52] Kyiv: what r u doing r n [00:52] Me: makes sense its a shit time to be looting [00:52] Me: applying to jobs [00:52] Me: i got rejected to 8 more since we last spoke [00:52] Kyiv: gg Kyiv started a call that lasted an hour. (unrecorded conversation) Kyiv: I think they were just expecting to be greeted with flowers like they were in donesk and luhansk, but when they went deeper, old people in villages were throwing themselves under tanks to stop them. Our defence minister said, they will keep being greeted with flowers but they will be on their graves. Me: I guess for Ukraine, nationalism and patriotism is only really high right now because its just gotten attacked. But the fact that so many civilians are willing to just die for the cause right now. I feel like most places in the world, among the general populace at least, they just dont have that Kyiv: I guess theres just an ongoing struggle for freedom and identity that kind of instils this patriotism and nationalism in people. Like constant wars and oppression from Russian side, 20th century was basically hell. It was like you were persecuted just for being Ukrainian. So that kind of instils that strong identity when youre among Russians. When you live in Soviet Union, and youre Ukrainian and they hear you speak Ukrainian, then youre instantly a fucking low life retard, so you have to speak Russian so that people dont think youre retarded. Me: That makes sense Kyiv: of that kind of, you know. Theres perpetual anger growing inside of you, toward Russians, and a kind of longing to be Ukrainian and to finally have a country and nation thats united and strong enough to fend off all theI guessavenge all the things that happened. Me: I guess if you put it like that, its like the experience Ive been discussing with my ____ recently. Theres just a lot of similarities with the resistance against the Japanese he was there for, you know? Its not really necessarily liking a country or idea to a certain degree, but you eventually get tired of being slaves. And everyone who just doesnt want to be slaves and have barely anything else in common just unite. Kyiv: I guess that makes sense. Me: What a time to fucking be alive bro. Didnt think Id fucking see this shit. Well, you know what? I guess I did think I would see this day eventually. Just not so soon, you know? Kyiv: Man, everyone thought Putin was bluffing. Except for Americans, they were like bruh theyre gonna invade at any time now. But Ukrainians were like nah, bro are you joking? Me: bro look at this though. I still have a cat at least Kyiv: piece of shit. Me: Aw man So, its been a few days What do you think the chances of Ukraine still being in country by the time this shits over Kyiv: Chances are pretty high, the question is how much damage will we endure? Because Russians have been bombing major cities, destroying old infrastructure, hospitals, kindergartens, schools, just regular buildings where people live. Theres already a lot of damage done and its not over yet Me: that makes sense Kyiv: and how much of it how much land well be able to retain by the end Me: Kind of weird that, militarily, in terms of like actual military forces not just like, Bro you want like five bullets? Isnt it kinda funny that there are countries sending military to help Russia but no ones helping Ukraine even though the entire worlds like aw man, pray for Ukraine Kyiv: What do you mean military, do you mean Belarus Me: Is it just Belarus? Kyiv: Well, I mean, there are Chechens but Chechens are part of Russia. I mean, Ukraine is now opening for volunteers from several countries the chechen that fled the country during the war kind of want to go back to Ukraine and fight the chechen that won the war because the Chechen that won the war are all retarded. There are Belarusians in Ukraine that disagree with Lukashenko and they, too, want to join the war. The Foreign Legion, dutch volunteers, well I mean theres several. Its not a lot but its still something Me: I guess it helps morale at least Kyiv: Yeah, well the weapons are good and apparently Russians cannot fucking fight. Like I dont know what the fuck their strategy is but theyve already lost a shit ton. A convoys just been deployed here and it all immediately got destroyed by fucking Turkish planes and whatever gets close to the cities, or is already in the cities, gets destroyed by a fucking military or paramilitary stingers and javelins. Me: Fuck I was expecting just babushkas and molotovs bruh Kyiv: Well that happens, too. In villages, people make molotovs and they destroyed btrs Me: Frugal living Yeah I remember when we talked when this first started? You were like, fuck, I guess we will disappear in five minutes. And then somehow Ukraine is doing well. Well, I guess you cant really do well in this situation but its not as bad as expected Kyiv: Ukrainian military is doing surprisingly well. Thats pretty good. And a lot of people are coming back from other countries, my dads friend from childhood who lives in Canada is already on the way to the Ukraine to fight the war. Me: fuck I wish I was on the way Man, I was super ready to join the Foreign Legion I was like fuck if Im gonna die I might as well be fighting the Russians bro theres no better way to die (private) Kyiv: just like in Call of Duty Me: exactly Kyiv: I was always asking myself like why do they always make Russians the enemy until now Me: Do you remember that one satire video about a Call of Duty pro player who joined ISIS and then got quickscoped thats a classic Then they asked his friends what do you think happened and they said, fuck, maybe he got fucking spawncamped by some asshole. You got to spawn camp the Russians dude, just go to Moscow now. Kyiv: Holy shit bro, just kill Putin. Putin is just sitting in some bunker. Nobody knows where he is. Me: I guess we saw that coming. Man, is Zelenskyy still in Kyiv. Thats pretty impressive, didnt the last two presidents both flee to Russia or something? Kyiv: Well, in 2014, the president, the prime minister and some other fucking politicians fled to Russia and theyre still in Russia. I think I saw them on the news just a few days ago. Theyre all like, Well, yeah, there is a Nazi rule in Ukraine, so you got to liberate the country. And I was like, Oh man, there was Poroshenko he was a president for like four or five years. Me: I mean, Kyiv: Part of the reason why this defense was so successful was due to Poroshenko. He had many faults, like his way of dealing with the oligarchs was just kind of sus. But he kind of reinvented the training military, because everything before that were just non existant. There was zero budget, and in the military, we had no soldiers and nothing. When the war in Donbass started, he started investing a lot of money in military so at least when Russia invaded we had some soldiers and military bases and defences Me: You think youre going to fight? Kyiv: Well, people who volunteer to fight say that theres like fucking three guns for 10 people because theyre just too many volunteers and not enough weaponry. So if I were to join now, I wouldnt have a weapon, I will just be following the others while catching looters and tying them to lightpoles. Me: yeah so instead of joining a kingdom, you can just be the roaming war party just fighting looters. Thats just the early game, you know, then you can go to tournaments. Kyiv: Can I quicksave? Me: This is like one of those times when you start the game and say dont let me quit without saving then you get stuck in a wall and lose all your progress. Kyiv: Worse than dying bruh Me: I guess catching looters is pretty important, other people need that shit Kyiv: We do construction so we got an order from the Ukrainian military to construct hedgehogs. Me: Dont you guys only have four people working for you? Kyiv: Around four people in the office but heres like 20 people at the factory Me: Thats good because I remember last time I was talking to you about it and you were driving like, yeah, I need to go to the factory because someone else was supposed to go but he disappeared Kyiv: I dont know, everythings fucking gone dude Me: Was it like the guy who got kidnapped and chained to the radiator What are you guys building Kyiv: hedgehogs Me: what are those Kyiv: Have you seen clips from war movies, like on the beach at d-day, the fucking giant metal spikes? Me: Oh, those are called hedgehogs, I didnt even know that Kyiv: Yeah, just to stop tanks Me: I wrote about them in this story, I called them barricades because I googled spiky shit and it didnt come up with anything Kyiv: come on bro Me: fuck Kyiv: Its so hard to do anything useful. If I go there theres nothing for me to do since no weapons, if I stay here, theres nothing for me to do since Im just watching them build. So fucking useless Me: Make molotovs at home Kyiv: No ingredients. At home I have a pistol with rubber bullets, most I can do is probably shoot myself in the head Me: You probably wont even die, just hurts Kyiv: you can actually die Me: well it depends like the gun right Kyiv: its a 9 mil pistol Me: guess it depends more on the bullet Kyiv: theres still gunpowder in it, just the metal part is replaced with rubber Me: severe brain damage Kyiv: if you get shot in the eye or the temple or maybe even the liver, you might die Me: Remember that meme about stalker with the guy holding pistol like shotgun and it just says you wont miss because fear of shooting hand I remember this video of a guy playing vr Counter Strike. And he was dual wielding AKs. But if you hold it in one hand, if you shoot one bullet, the recoil would just knock it out your hand. So he tried to rush the door with the AKs and he only shot two bullets and both guns bounced off and then he died. Kyiv: Remember we played paintball and _____ was there just going fucking terminator mode and would hold two guns and he would just walk like this with two guns and shoot at the tent where people are hiding. But like while he was walking there, he got shot like 20 times but he wouldnt stop Me: I know, I was one of the people who shot him good times (private conversation) (call ends) [01:47] Me: [01:48] Kyiv: [01:48] Kyiv: sanic [01:48] Me: fucking [01:48] Me: hedgehogs [01:48] Me: didnt know they were called that until you start building them 3/3 [02:10] Me: [08:19] Kyiv: https://youtu.be/82oJt2enz8A [12:50] Me: oh shit video games 4/3 14:25] Kyiv: man [14:26] Kyiv: so far ukraine is able to defend the flanks [14:27] Kyiv: and if the west is able to keep up its promises with weapons supply and russia doesnt get any support we might have a chance [14:27] Me: holy shit [14:27] Kyiv: things can go sideways any time [14:27] Me: chinas state banks all pulled out of russia [14:28] Me: i dont think a few extra hobos from belarus is going to make a difference [14:28] Kyiv: they might make an impact since they are walking distance from kyiv [14:28] Kyiv: and if we lose kyiv [14:28] Kyiv: its gg [14:29] Kyiv: but i think lukashenko pussied out of it [14:29] Kyiv: and balarusians dont wanna fight ukrainians [14:29] Me: does russia even need to worry about [14:29] Me: supply lines or whatever [14:29] Me: arent they all based in eastern ukraine now [14:29] Me: and going to kyiv from there [14:30] Kyiv: its still a long way from the eastern front. i think they banked on the troops in the north to take kyiv in no time [14:30] Kyiv: but that didnt go according to plan [14:30] Kyiv: so far [14:30] Kyiv: there is still a threat from north [14:30] Kyiv: and they are taking a lot of land from the south as well [14:31] Me: fuck [14:31] Me: cant wait for sabaton to write a song about this [14:31] Kyiv: listened to the new sabaton new album yesterday [14:31] Kyiv: idk bro [14:31] Kyiv: didnt really like it [14:32] Kyiv: i think if there was no great war album id actually be able to enjoy it [14:33] Me: yea i know what you mean [14:33] Me: every part of it was a masterpiece [14:33] Kyiv: it might be that their greatest album is great war and everything they release now is just going to be compared to it [14:33] Me: man [14:33] Me: honestly cant believe kyiv still exists [14:33] Kyiv: same [14:34] Kyiv: if we can hold for one more week [14:34] Kyiv: well know if ukraine has a chance or not [14:35] Kyiv: if we win [14:35] Kyiv: i dont even fucking know bro [14:35] Kyiv: its like [14:35] Kyiv: everything that didnt make sense would make even less sense [14:36] Me: i feel like i havent been living in different reality for so long [14:36] Me: real life is just absolute insanity [14:36] Me: everything is a paradox [14:36] Me: gotta fucking [14:36] Me: retreat back into my corner of perplexity bruh [14:37] Kyiv: mr gibson would approve [14:37] Kyiv: cant fucking believe this shit is happening [14:38] Kyiv: biden warned everyone that the attack was imminent but people just couldn;t fathom this course of events [14:38] Kyiv: it just defied any logic [14:38] Kyiv: and then all of a sudden it became reality [14:38] Kyiv: and everyone was like [14:38] Kyiv: shenme [14:40] Me: yea man [14:40] Me: russians came [14:40] Me: and ukrainians were like [14:40] Me:  [14:40] Kyiv: the nuclear threat is kinda fucked tho [14:41] Kyiv: cant even get iodine pills anywhere [14:41] Me: man [14:42] Me: arent private pharm companies starting to supply them [14:43] Kyiv: russians kadirov troops which are basically muslim extremists took over the chernobyl and zaporozhian nuclear power plants [14:44] Kyiv: cant predict anything when those fgts are involved [14:44] Kyiv: the pills are all out of stock [14:45] Me: fuck [14:47] Me: oh its chechens [14:47] Me: i can see that being worrying [14:48] Kyiv: the chechens that fled the chechen wars in russia are now fighting on our side now [14:49] Kyiv: thats a good thing since they are well trained and have personal hatred toward russian chechens [14:51] Kyiv: NATOs inability to help out with troops and securing ukraines airspace is kinda frustrating but i guess well just have to do with what we have [14:51] Kyiv: the promised jets are taking a while tho [14:51] Me: i mean its like [14:51] Me: does nato really want to be a friend of ukraine [14:52] Me: or do they just want russia to take as many losses as possible [14:52] Me: without costing them anything [14:52] Kyiv: in my opinion [14:52] Kyiv: nato just wants russia to lose [14:52] Kyiv: but they dont want an open conflict with them [14:52] Kyiv: cuz it would essentially mean ww3 [14:53] Kyiv: so they are just supplying us with weapons [14:53] Kyiv: disregarding the losses we might endure [14:54] Kyiv: im at the same time grateful and displeased [14:55] Kyiv: what are you doing rn [14:55] Me: being depressed [14:55] Kyiv: good Kyiv started a call that lasted 2 hours. (unrecorded conversation) Kyiv: If we can hold kyiv for 7 days, we might have a chance to fight back Me: Is there a specific reason for like seven days or Kyiv: There is a specific reason, its because he utilised 9% of the fucking military force that he planted across the fucking border. And everything fucking went sideways. So within seven days, the army that he amassed at the borders is going to be destroyed if we hold on the resistance and if Kiev doesnt collapse because he has already run out of supplies, because he has been bombarding the fucking cities non-stop hes running out of fucking ammunition. And the factories that manufacture ammunition cannot supply him with enough ammunition to keep going. So he kind of went all in on Ukraine, but he failed because he did not anticipate the kind of resistance and the support from the woods. Because he thought that wasnt going to do the same shit as Donbass and Crimea, just ignore the issue Me: I watched a seminar about this, it was like an older recorded one from like, 2015 or so when Crimea was just taken. They mentioned how the West wanted to expand influence into Ukraine without making Ukraine a part of EU or NATO. And Russia wanted Ukraine to be like, how do you say, kind of like a border country between Russia and the West,. Kyiv: It expands beyond that. If you listen to Russian news, I mean, with subtitles, or if you took enough Russian classes, you can just watch the originals, its fucking insane. He basically says that were a brother nation and hes liberating us from the Nazi role. And he wants to reunite Ukraine and Russia, basically to reinstate the USSR. And the majority of Russian people support it. Just a few days ago, there was a fucking, you know like, street kind of questionnaire, I suppose. They were like, do you want to see pictures from Ukraine after the invasion? And do you still support Putin and after you see these pictures, and a lot of people are like, I dont even want to see the pictures, I support Putin because Hes our leader, and he is liberating Ukraine from the Nazi rule. And at this point, Im just questioning myself. Before I was like, okay, Russian people, they just have to unite. Like the youth has to unite and just like basically, go for revolution at this point, because thats the only way but now, I think that Russia has to be fucking nuked. Theres just no hope for Russia because the majority of people is not the youth, it is the people who support Putin. Me: This is insane. to even think about. This feels like something Kyiv: All the fucking opposition TV channels, radio stations and media channels were closed because they were talking about Russia invading Ukraine, and the whole mentioning of Russia invading Ukraine and not being the fucking special operation, as they call it, and not a liberation mission is basically a national crime now, and anyone who says that Russia is invading Ukraine is going to be sentenced to 15 years in jail. Its basically becoming North Korea this point. Me: its hard to even imagine that this is shit thats happening now, you know. I guess the last time something like this happened that was comparable was when the Americans invaded Iraq but that was almost 20 years ago Kyiv: I dont know bro the kind of broken propaganda thats happening in Russia right now use like the Soviet propaganda because the even released the fucking cartoons for kids that Ukraine was friends with Russia. But then Ukraine went to a different button class and they met Americans and European countries. Thats like an actual fucking cartoon, Ukraine went to different class, they got new friends and then they started chasing after the fucking proclaimed Donetsk and Lugansk Republics. Theyre actually like kids in fucking flags. Their clothes are painted in flags, and Ukraine is chasing after them with a stick and Russia is standing up for them. The pinnacle of that cartoon is that Russia takes the stick from the Ukrainian kid. And the kids in like dress in the fucking American and European clothes. Theyre like shaming that fucking Russian kid for taking the stick from Ukrainian kid. When my mom watched that cartoon, she was like, bruh this is fucking USSR, this is the shit we watched when we were fucking kids. Russia is basically regressing into USSR but at this point they have even less power than before. Me: I dont know. Some people Im talking to are like, man, you know, its not the Russians is just Putin. But like I dont know, where does Putins power come from, right, like theres people who support him. If like everyone in Russia didnt like Putin, this wouldnt happen. Kyiv: [russian] people in the streets that are fighting for independence, for Ukraine I suppose or at least to stop the work, Im thankful to those people, but the people who support Putin, or who are neutral theyre basically the enemies of the state. Because people who are neutral and do not take stance on either one of those positions are basically supporting Putin because inactivity indirectly supports Putin. Me: I guess that makes sense. Im just thinking if you were a Russian in Russia, and you didnt support the war, what would you do? Do you protest and get arrested instantly? Do you like defect to Ukraine? Like how many options do you really have, you know? Kyiv: Well, its hard to say from this position that I am in right now. But hypothetically, I would probably go out and protest because its the only chance to overtake the government because revolutions always ends in blood, a proper revolution, the kind that has effect. Whatever the fuck they doing right now is not having any effect because theyre fucking pussies. Just like the revolution that we had in the fucking 2014 People went on the streets and a lot of people died but we had new democratic government, but democracy, I feel like democracy is just like an unknown concept to Russia. They just long for a fucking monarchy or autocracy? Me: Wasnt the Ukrainian president that got overthrown democratically elected? Kyiv: No, he rigged the election just like Lukashenko did. A lot of people voted for him, but it wasnt enough to get the victory so he rigged the election. People kind of revolted then, but it was kind of subdued. But when it all really started when he promised the Ukrainian people that he would join the EU. But then he went to the Congress, and he said that he would not join the EU because it would worsen the relationship with Russia and it wouldnt wouldnt be in the interest of Ukraine to join the EU and thats when the people finally revolted because they were like, we want to have nothing to do with fucking Russia because theyre fucking retarded and theyre oppressing, we want to be a part of EU because we dont want to be in USSR at this point. Then it just fucking went sideways and a lot of people died but he fled to Russia and so did a lot of his ministers and politicians so we elected the new government, democratically at least. Me: I remember when Kyiv: What we have right now that is deemed fucking Nazi in Russia for some reason was democratically elected as well. And the election was not rigged this time. Me: I remember when Zelenskyy first got elected and we talked about it and you were making fun of how all the choices were bad and the guy that got chosen used to be a comedian but now its war and hes stepping up Kyiv: Well, I mean, yeah, I still hold on to the position because economically, when he was president without war, it was not all that good but now the situation were at right now, hes stepping up as not only a president, he is like the major commander of the army and the resistance against the Russian invaders and he is performing even better than I couldnt even anticipate Me: I guess its kind of like Churchill isnt it? People called him a good leader during war but Kyiv: Yes, like hes a war time champion, but when the peace time happens its just, Oh, man cant wait to get rid of this guy Me: Either way, the fact Zelenskyy is out in the streets in the city actively being attacked while Putin is fucking around in a bunker is pretty funny. Kyiv: Before, I was making fun of this guy, but if he goes for a second term, Ill fucking vote for him bruh. Me: Ey Kyiv: because like, this shit was unexpected, and I did not expect him to behave this way. And since hes behaving this way, hes fucking earned my respect. Me: Im sure you guys got this. Kyiv: Fucking hope so, theres no other way. Cant believe this shit is happening. I dont know, it was kind of a weird feeling because when I started writing again I thought back to like the poems and the stuff I was writing in high school. I thought Id definitely write something meaningful to myself in Russian. Then I thought I would probably write something English. But at this point I feel like writing in Ukrainian would be more liberating I guess. Writing in Ukrainian nowadays seems more natural. And since this is the first time writing in Ukrainian, it feels like Im not actually mimicking anyone, you know what I mean? Because when I write in Russian, I dont try to mimic but it just happens that I mimic the people Ive read and same thing in English, I mimic the people that I read. But, in Ukrainian, since I havent read shit in Ukrainian, it doesnt feel like Im mimicking anyone. If I had I might feel like I was mimicking someone else too Me: Maybe youre mimicking yourself Kyiv: Fuck me, worst case scenario What about the blog the other person suggested Me: Oh, Im still making it one of my friends is helping me finish making the website. Were making a really minimalistic GitHub website where theres like nothing except for the text so like it feels more isolated. Kyiv: I have an archive of some really explicit pictures I would say Me: of the war or of yourself Kyiv: nothing explicit about myself Me: I dont know, I mean, Im not gonna ask you to like send shit to me that you dont want to write but theres anything you think is interesting that maybe I could make into a project to go public. (private conversation) Me: So, now is your main thing just building hedgehogs? Kyiv: No, it was just a one-time order because the place where our factory is in a hot zone now. So were basically supplying our workers who live at the factory with food. They have enough food for now. Theyll be able to last for seven days at least, maybe two weeks? Well, the hot zone is northeast of Kiev, where all the action happens so were kind of in the danger zone. At this point were just hoping that all the stuff that we have so far doesnt get destroyed. But, I dont think thats the main concern right now. The main concern is just that Russia doesnt take over Kyiv and Ukraine is whole and they dont instate their own government because thatll be a fucking disaster. There will be the end of it. The end of everything I suppose. Me: yeah that makes sense what do you think are the chances of you ending up actually fighting Kyiv: Well, if Kyiv is surrounded and ends up in a complete blockade, Ill end up fighting. Because right now ,like even this guy, my coworker, he volunteered on day two, I think. He went there but they didnt really have any weapons, it was three weapons for 10 people or 2 for 10 people. It was fucking stOnks at this point. Were now waiting for the western supplies but, for now, we have enough volunteers and drafted people who are able to fight in the army right now so were good. But if Kyiv ends up in a blockade or ends up in a situation when normal people have to go out in the streets because the militarys done enough, Ill probably go, (private conversation) Me: Thats kind of true, isnt it Kyiv: True, but at this point, if a rock gets thrown at me Ill die anyways, because I wont be thrown rocks at by people, it will be by fucking shells and I will just be done right there I dont give a shit, bro. Because this point, I cannot even imagine myself living in any different country. I tried China. I tried Canada. And those two countries are pretty good countries to live in, you know? But I still felt out of place. Ukraine is the only country I feel like I belong to and it feels wrong not to fight for it. Me: I know what you mean Kyiv: Right now, I cannot do anything, but if the resistance comes to a point where it doesnt even matter what you can do and becomes just about showing up and doing whatever you can to resist. Ill fucking do it. I dont care. Cant imagine living under Russian rule The problem with whats going on here is the Russians were told they were doing training, but then people start fighting back so they fight too and start finding out this isnt training, this is something else. But this is where the problems start, all the soldiers that were captured, most of them were born in 2000-2001. And they all say the same shit. Theyre like, Oh, we dont know where we were, we dont know what the fuck were doing, we were shooting at the fucking civilian buildings as part of the training. Here is where comes the question: Are they lying? Or is this the kind of thing theyre told to say when they were captured? Oh, we didnt know what the fuck or whatever. We didnt know what the fuck were doing. I guess this is part of the training (private conversation) Kyiv: The thing is, apart from my experience, like the entire fight, the war, all the stuff that I get is still a second-hand experience. Like yeah, I see stuff on the news. But thats the people taking pictures, then it gets then it gets circulated by the news, and the media and their telegram channels and like the activists and all that crap and then I witness the end result. So, the experience that I get are just secondhand. My personal experience is just like my ruminations and speculation of what might happen know what might not happen. Like how the death toll that is still unknown from both sides Me: I mean, if you like, dont want me to publish it, then like, I get it, right. Its just, I dont know, its like, Kyiv: not that I dont want you to Oh, its more like, Im just wondering what its gonna be. Me: Well, its just, I want to make this as raw as possible. Like, I dont want to do a really fantastical version of things. I dont think everything needs to be completely accurate, because its still about perspective, right? Its just if I didnt talk to you every day, then I wouldnt know anything about anything, you know? Like, really, when it comes to my motivation, thats it. Like, the only reason I know anything about whats happening is because Im talking to you. If all I did was watch the news, all I would see is just people saying, oh, man, so like, yeah, Russia invaded Ukraine. Thats why gas prices are high. And that doesnt help me. Kyiv: I mean, Im just wondering if I can, like, probably gather more intel from like, the media and experiences that people have. Because if its just my experience, then its just gonna be, I guess, sort of unimportant because Im just, Im not in the war zone. Im just kind of like, in the outskirts of Kiev where barely anything happens. A lot of people here have a way harder time than me. Me: I dont think you need to compete with other people about how hard the times are. I feel like whenever something bad happens, like both of us, its our nature for our first instinct to be well, you know, this is kind of shit. But other people probably have it worse. So I dont really get to complain. But Im just thinking that might not be how it always gotta be. Kyiv: Oh, definitely know what you mean. Me: Yeah. Like any perspective is helpful. The closest that people who are not firsthand experiencing something can get to the truth is by understanding as many perspectives as possible. So in that sense, your perspective is just as important as anyone elses. Kyiv: Yeah, but in that sense, it would make more sense to gather more perspective around Me: True, but I dont know anyone like I know you. I dont just mean I dont know anyone else in Ukraine like I know you. I mean I dont know anyone anywhere like I know you. So, if I personally wrote about anyone else, it wouldnt work. Me: So, in this way, me personally, I cant write about anyone elses perspective. Even though having other peoples perspectives are helpful. Thats not something Im capable of doing, because the only person I actually know is you. Kyiv: That makes sense. But I feel like sometimes its hard to comprehend my own perspective. Like, its easier to speculate the other persons perspective and guess what they think, what they feel as opposed to exposing what you feel and what you see. Because a lot of the stuff that I see just goes in the backburner and you just dont really think about it, but might make an impact for some people. Its just the reality. I dont really think about it that much. Im just like oh, yeah, of course that happened because thats the reality right now. But for other people it will be like, holy shit what the fuck Sometimes, its hard to remember those times because its such a norm at this point, you know Its fucked up to say but it is a norm at this point for people to die and for people to get demolished in a fucking airstrike. And when people say like, whats up? I dont say that shit. I just say like, Well, yeah, everything is as usual. But nobody knows what it entails, except for me. So, its hard to even describe for myself how I feel about this whole predicament. (private conversation) Kyiv: I really hate the word interview. Like I really hate what it implies, just interview. It feels like its not talking to people its interview, like you want to get something out of it. Me: Yeah, I know you mean, it feels less personal. I dont know, maybe Im just emotionally traumatised from job interviews. Its always I see that you do not have any experience in this industry, so what makes you think that you can work here though? How do I get experience if I dont got jobs. I didnt even have the work experience to join the Foreign Legion bro. What the fuck Kyiv: I mean, what the fuck did you expect bro Me: I dont know, I thought maybe I could just like get there and die instantly and I could become fertiliser you guys might need afterwards I dont know my brain hasnt been working. Its like what I said earlier, nothing feels real and I dont know what Im doing anymore. (private conversation) Kyiv: There are things I need to be alive for, but, at the same time. I feel wrong for other people to die for me. Me: Remember that really old text we had? Well, not that old, like a week ago where I said, this is a lose lose situation because whether you fight or dont fight, you will betray someone. And then you said well, actually, I dont know anyone crazy enough to join. But now its actually become that situation. So we just need to decide who are you more willing to betray? Kyiv: I feel like when Im fighting, Im betraying myself Me: Are you willing to betray yourself? Kyiv: For some reason, to me, betraying myself is not as dire or devastating as betraying _______. I dont know how to explain it. But I feel like like my responsibility before _______ overweighs my responsibility for myself and despite me willing to fight, I cannot even fathom the idea of _______ suffering as a result of me dying. Even though it sounds kind of selfish, in a way, because it sounds like Im just using an excuse for not fighting. But to be honest, I wanted to fucking die a long time before I even comprehended this fucking idea. In the end, I never cared about dying, but I really I really care about _______, and I wouldnt really want _________________. But to be honest, if it was not for _______. I would join on the fucking 24th of February. If anyone else wanted to stop me, I wouldnt care. (private conversation) Me: Yeah, this is your internal journey. This is your story. Your story is in the fucking making. dont know, we write a lot of stories, you know. We always think fuck, the internal journey here is not good, the external journey here is not good. But how many people live and die with an actual journey of their own. Your journey here means something to you so it might mean something to other people. This is the only kind of memoir that makes sense. If I ever write one, its just gonna be about me applying to jobs and getting rejected for 10 years and then dying in a ditch. Thats not gonna help people but yours might. Kyiv: Your memoir is gonna be about fishing with your granddad then planting fucking tomatoes in the shade that actually fucking grows. Thatll be fucking impressive. Me: How he planted tomatoes in the gravel, I dont even know bruh Kyiv: Nobody even knew it was possible. Honestly, though, like, do you think theres any reason to even post this shit? Like if I were to write a memoir, should I even share it with anyone? Me: I think you should. I think this is important. Ive written so much bullshit that doesnt do anything except just be mildly entertaining like _________. But the most famous writers die really young and they live really troubled lives. But I think theres no way to be good at writing without going through those experiences. Like for a writer, being depressed and paranoid for 20 years and then killing yourself at the age of 22 is completely normal. But thats just, Kyiv: yeah, I know, I read Bukowski. And because he says shit like, I was lucky enough to have a shit life. Me: Its not being a writer that causes it. Kyiv: Exactly, you cant be good at writing without those things. So its not writing causes the experiences. Its just the experiences. But this is barely a shit situation. Im here in the countryside, smoking shisha, having decent internet and warm and clothed. I have food to eat. Like I have nothing to complain about except for my inner struggles about this fuckin external situation. Me: internal struggles out the most important thing Kyiv: I just feel wrong about not being out there with the other guys just fighting for the freedom. Its like the Donbass conflict, fucking Putin and Poroshenko and whoever the fuck decided that shit, I didnt want to die in that conflict. But this time, this time is actually the Patriotic War. This is the war for independence. This is the war for freedom. This is the war that decides the future of this nation. And I didnt think I would even say this out loud, but right now it feels like I am a patriot because I want to die for this country. But the only thing that is stopping me is just shitty fucking guilt (private conversation) Kyiv: Aye bro, your brother from another mother. Jokes aside, I really consider people that are not blood related my family as well and youre part of that family. And Im not just like saying that lightly, like I really mean it. Because I really do consider us family because you can just come here anytime you want. I mean I dont mean now, like when things blow over, just come here. And if ______ doesnt block me or just fucking deport me again, Ill come to ________ Me: I dont know if what Im fucking saying makes any sense anymore, but Ive been trying to make it as a fucking writer for so long and pushing hard in personal ambitions and thats been a completely futile endeavour. But when we were in high school, we talked about what duty a person has. I remember this conversation well because you talked to T______ about it. Like if your country told you to kill civilians, would you do it? And T______ said he probably would. Then we had a discussion about that where we disagreed. You said you feel that loyalty is mostly about loyalty to our friends and family. But I argued that loyalty is mostly about being loyal to a cause or a personal ambition or something like that, but I think you were right the whole time. Kyiv: I mean, I dont really remember that conversation but I remember B______ and T_____s argument about bombing civilians. Yeah, like I guess loyalty to family and friends is the only thing we have since being loyal to cause could imply anything, it might imply any losses, any victories, but in the end, all you have is cause itself. And what cost does it come at? The victory of a cause. The victory of an idea. This is basically ideology, like do you die for your cause or do you die for your family and friends? Or directly related to you directly responsible for you and youre directly responsible for them? Or do you die for the cause that is implied upon you by the government or the society or yourself? I feel like family and friends like the only way to go. Because I remember there was another conversation about if your friend committed a crime or your family member committed a crime, would you give them in to the police? And obviously the answer is no because thats your family Im gonna give it away. I dont really give a shit about the fucking law system because its fucking rigged, like I dont care about justice when it comes to my family because I would just want to make my family out of that fucking predicament, I cant care about fucking justice at this point (private conversation) Kyiv: Thanks man, it really means a lot. Like, it does sound cringe when people say it really means a lot to me but like I really do mean it because for a long time youve already been part of my family so definitely I dont really perceive you as a friend anymore, its just like, you know, well, its just [my name] Me: Yeah, I cant believe I blocked you on Discord so many times. I also cant believe the biggest problem I had these last few weeks haemorrhoids. I mean I gotta admit theyre pretty painful and I still have them, like theyre still really hurting right now but compared to everything else is not that bad. What do you think is more painful, having haemorrhoids or your country being invaded? Kyiv: Definitely haemorrhoids, its a personal attack just to you. I dont know, bro. I just want to believe that maybe in a year from now, maybe even less than that, youll just come here and well smoke shisha and well just watch some old cartoons just like nothing has ever even fucking occurred here. Thatll be a really fucking dope feeling. As for your writing carrier, I feel like you just have to give it time because you have to have experience to write something meaningful, right? Me: I dont know. I dont really Kyiv: Like I know Stephen King just shits out a novel every fucking three weeks but I mean thats Stephen King, bro Me: I dont want you to fucking give a shit about my writing career right now. Its not really the time. I think right now, when we think about writing, we should think about your memoir Kyiv: My memoir will come in a while. Ill keep writing it but I hope to finish it after the war ends and hopefully the odds are in our favour because if the odds are not in our favour I will not finish my memoir Fucking hate talking about this petty shit like how my country just got bombarded.

dont know man. even azov that russians and western journalist call the most nazi division in ukraine consists of christians, jews and muslims. they do employ a nazi symbol but thats pretty much the extent of it. i feel like the term nazi has lost its meaning [04:23] Kyiv: dont really know why they used a black sun tho [04:29] Kyiv: i feel like theres going to be tremendous hatred toward russians and everything related to russia [04:29] Kyiv: and theres going to be an increase in nationalism [04:31] Kyiv: there might be an outburst of neo nazism but i think itll be generally condemned [04:31] me: cant imagine nazism becoming popular in a country with a jewish president [04:31] me: who everyone likes [04:33] Kyiv: judging from russias dogma, he and the rest of the administration are nazis

collaboration with germans in western ukraine [04:38] Kyiv: stepan bandera is one of the political figures who is associated with that movement and he has become a national hero of sorts that symbolises resistance and freedom. he is generally praised but theres this dissonance caused by the fact that some of his views were pretty extreme. [04:40] Kyiv: the hatred toward russians has always been there and now it just got solidified and perpetuated [04:45] Kyiv: cossacks vs moscow -&gt; serfdom -&gt; denied independence on multiple occasions-&gt; bloody resistance in 1910 - 1920s -&gt; holodomor -&gt; after ww2, even in 1960s and 1970s, speaking ukrainian and being associated with ukrainian culture is considered not prestigious

me: really like that guy [05:37] me: hes working towards the strength of chinese people [05:37] me: instead of being dishonest about it [05:37] me: acknowledging the shitty place chinese people are in in the world [05:37] me: because all these assholes propagating how cool chinese people are [05:38] me: just make chinese people go to other places expecting theyll be treated like equals [05:38] me: when they wont even be seen as humans [05:41] me: chinese people are too used to lying to make people feel better [05:41] me: and it translates into culture in a [05:41] me: really unfortunate way [05:41] Kyiv: ideology always leads to its followers being detached from reality [05:42] Kyiv: makes me wonder how US got away with all the shit they did in the middle east and other places. they lied to the entire world and got called out on multiple occasions but it led nowhere [05:43] Kyiv: US supported the use of chemical weapons in iran-iraq war [05:44] me: when you rule the world you decide what reality is [05:44] me: whats anyone going to do about it [05:45] me: the americans can invade a country, kill everyone, rape everyone and then not bother denying it [05:45] me: other people will talk about it but what will they do [05:45] Kyiv: that makes sense. i wonder if US will be able to maintain its power [05:45] Kyiv: china might challenge it at some point [05:45] me: china is powerful economically [05:45] me: but theres no equivalent to nato [05:46] me: a permanent military alliance is too powerful [05:46] me: even the [05:46] me: warsaw pact when it existed [05:46] me: was completely meaningless [05:48] me: i cant imagine the us falling off [05:48] Kyiv: obviously not, but EU dependence on russian natural resources and fear of conflict proves that other countries can push the geopolitical boundaries [05:48] me: internally, the way they do democracy is too smart [05:48] me: its just two parties which are the same thing [05:48] me: so everyone blames the other party instead of the entire country [05:49] me: and they can keep doing what theyre doing [05:49] me: internal dissent is always targeted towards a party [05:49] me: eu already cut a lot of their gas from russia [05:49] me: well [05:49] me: the way putin is pushing geopolitical boundaries rn [05:49] Kyiv: yeah, thats pretty smart. remember how they blamed 9/11 on the wrong country just to have a reason to invade it lol [05:50] me: is probably not the best ay [05:50] me: right and when they tortured everyone in iraq [05:50] me: people were just like [05:50] me: fucking bush [05:51] Kyiv: yeah. they just said this is very bad and that was it [05:51] Kyiv: un is such a joke [05:51] me: remember when clinton didnt let anyone send weapons during the bosnian war [05:51] me: because not killing all muslims in europe didnt make sense [05:52] me: do you think ukraine membership in nato is a good idea [05:52] me: because youll get military support to some degree [05:52] me: but youll also just be even more of an enemy to russia [05:53] me: and youll still be closest to them [05:55] Kyiv: i dont think ukraine will ever be a part of nato unless russia changes into a democratic state [05:56]

ukraine [06:00] me: theres no way they can hold it [06:00] Kyiv: yeah but they have the potential to turn half of ukraine into dust [06:01] Kyiv: the western countries keep promising shit but they never deliver [06:02] me: for them ukraine and russia both getting destroyed is probably a fuking [06:02] me: what is the saying even [06:02] me: sucking two dicks with one ass [06:02] Kyiv: yeah, something like that [06:02] Kyiv: they dont care about ukraine and they dont like russia [06:02] Kyiv: both countries not existing anymore would only improve their quality of life [06:02] me: should

black sun woman on womans day [04:22] Kyiv: i dont know man. even azov that russians and western journalist call the most nazi division in ukraine consists of christians, jews and muslims. they do employ a nazi symbol but thats pretty much the extent of it. i feel like the term nazi has lost its meaning [04:23] Kyiv: dont really know why they used a black sun tho [04:29] Kyiv: i feel like theres going to be tremendous hatred toward russians and everything related to russia [04:29] Kyiv: and theres going to be an increase in nationalism [04:31] Kyiv: there might be an outburst of neo nazism but i think itll be generally condemned [04:31] me: cant imagine nazism becoming popular in a country with a jewish president [04:31] me: who everyone likes [04:33] Kyiv: judging from russias dogma, he and the rest of the administration are nazis and they basically seized the government control [04:33] Kyiv: but he was democratically elected [04:33] Kyiv: which is a concept foreign to russians [04:33] me: personally [04:34] me: always fucks me up when slavs become nazis [04:34] me: its like if I joined the kkk [04:35] Kyiv: well, the only nazi slavs rn are russians and i can barely call them slavs [04:36] Kyiv: theres history of fascism and collaboration with germans in western ukraine [04:38] Kyiv: stepan bandera is one of the political figures who is associated with that movement and he has become a national hero of sorts that symbolises resistance and freedom. he is generally praised but theres this dissonance caused by the fact that some of his views were pretty extreme. [04:40] Kyiv: the hatred toward russians has always been there and now it just got solidified and perpetuated [04:45] Kyiv: cossacks vs moscow -&gt; serfdom -&gt; denied independence on multiple occasions-&gt; bloody resistance in 1910 - 1920s -&gt; holodomor -&gt; after ww2, even in 1960s and 1970s, speaking ukrainian and being associated with ukrainian culture is considered not prestigious and very often punished by imprisonment [04:47] Kyiv: theres this story of a ukrainian poet vasiliy stus who was sentenced to 10 years of labour camps for praising ukraine which was equated to extremism [04:47] me: werent cossacks tartars [04:49] Kyiv: no [04:49] me: man [04:50] Kyiv: jiji [04:52] Kyiv: [04:52] Kyiv: sosig [04:52] Kyiv: ehat timr is it in bc [04:55] me: 5am [04:55] me:

as in chinese [04:59] me: what the fuck [04:59] me: the only thing i was better at in chinese was speaking [04:59] Kyiv: how dis possible [04:59] Kyiv: man [05:00] me: i think its because they dont test typing and only reading [05:00] me: and i can barely read either language [05:00] me: man ive given up on being canadian [05:00] me: i was pretty patriotic as a kid [05:00] me: but like everyone just doesnt like me by default [05:01] me: so why bother [05:01] me: but man im also tired of being nomad [05:01] me: when it comes down to it though [05:01] me: i have a few good friends [05:01] me:

me: really like that guy [05:37] me: hes working towards the strength of chinese people [05:37] me: instead of being dishonest about it [05:37] me: acknowledging the shitty place chinese people are in in the world [05:37] me: because all these assholes propagating how cool chinese people are [05:38] me: just make chinese people go to other places expecting theyll be treated like equals [05:38] me:

[22:32] Me: it was the guy who did like palm reading or something [22:32] Me: and read the palm of the magician who couldnt do magic and had pants below his ass [22:33] Kyiv: shit [22:33] Kyiv: i dont remember [22:37] Me: i like how we rememebr different details about probably the same person [22:37] Me: but now that i think about it [22:37] Me: i think he was hungarian [22:37] Me: he talked about lao zi right [22:37] Kyiv: i think so [22:37] Kyiv: we only met him once [22:37] Me: yea [22:37] Kyiv: he was white [22:37] Kyiv: and fat [22:37] Me: yea [22:37] Me: ok same guy [22:37] Kyiv: and probably had a beard [22:37] Kyiv: although im not sure [22:38] Kyiv: i dont remember the palm reading bit [22:39] Me: he didnt read our palms [22:39] Me: only the magicians one [22:40] Kyiv: was it that annoying russian magician [22:43] Me: yea [22:44] Kyiv: fuck that guy [22:44] Kyiv: i think his name was dmitriy [22:44] Kyiv: or was it max [22:44] Kyiv: shit i dont remember [22:44] Kyiv: i definitely remember his friends name [22:44] Kyiv: yaroslav [22:45] Me: was that the guy who said [22:45] Me: your balls are empty [22:45] Kyiv: yeah thats yaroslav [22:45] Kyiv: i met him at least 5 times outside of our shisha place [22:45] Kyiv: at different shisha places [22:46] Kyiv: cuz every time i went somewhere and got a spontaneous urge to smoke shisha [22:47] Kyiv: he was already at the closest shisha place with his pals [22:47] Kyiv: i dont even know what he did for a living tbh [22:48] Kyiv: i think he was like 25 but he looked and sounded 15 [22:52] Me: fuck [22:52] Me: like that guy with the ipad [22:52] Me: professional lung cancer connoisseur [22:56] Kyiv: simpler times [22:57] Kyiv: [23:06] Me: fuck [23:06] Me: really was simpler times [23:06] Me: i was wondering something [23:07] Me: so on the news here [23:07] Me: well not really the news [23:07] Me: just in general [23:07] Me: when people talk about the war [23:07] Me: they always say the only enemy is putin but normal russians are victims and it looks like they have a lot of sympathy for them [23:07] Me: but like [23:08] Me: obviously this doesnt happen when theyre mad at other countries its just shit we got to kill everyone [23:08] Me: do you think its just because like [23:08] Me: russians are white [23:08] Me: christians i guess [23:08] Me: or is it just putins reputation as a person [23:09] Kyiv: it might be partially because of religion [23:09] Kyiv: and putin being a dictator so people are more inclined to blame everything on him [23:09] Me: i dont know i just remember researching sinophobia for my paper last year [23:10] Me: and all the articles are just [23:10] Me: the only solution is nuking everyone on china [23:10] Me: even though the problem was just chinese tech companies are growing faster [23:10] Me: and its like [23:10] Me: is it just about race and religion [23:10] Me: i feel like theres more to it [23:10] Me: same thing with all the middle eastern coutnries [23:12] Me: because based on what ive heard from you [23:12] Me: ukrainians just dont like russians in general [23:13] Kyiv: i think it all has a lot to do with how media thats influenced by politicians who are influenced by business people are pinning everything not on individuals who are posing a threat but its on the entire nation. you never hear people mention those ceos and companies, they always say china [23:13] Kyiv: and as practice shows people are stupid [23:16] Kyiv: because its easy to a find a way to hate a group of people as every group has social layers that could be picked on for being different from yours. the first layer could be race, the next could be religion, then nation, and you can keep going indefinitely. [23:17] Kyiv: and i feel like in case with china, its a mix of layers [23:17] Kyiv: its race [23:17] Kyiv: its communism [23:18] Kyiv: perhaps the foreign financial policies that threaten the west and are labelled as bad but in reality are only bad for the west [23:19] Me: i feel like the paper i wrote might have been too general [23:19] Me: because one of the main points of the essay [23:20] Me: was how everyone from the same race/country gets referred to when the media talks about something they dont like from somewhere else [23:20] Me: but its different this time [23:20] Me: no one here says man russians fucking suck [23:20] Me: its just oh man putin personally [23:20] Me: so i feel like theres more nuance to it than my paper suggested [23:21] Me: and it only applies to some places with the right layers like you said [23:22] Kyiv: thats interesting [23:22] Kyiv: ive never thought about it [23:23] Me: i didnt really think about it until today [23:23] Me: i saw an article talking about how ukrainains refugees are talked about different than arabic refugees [23:23] Me: with one newscaster straight up saying theyre white [23:24] Me: and i was reading comments about how only putin is the enemy and everyone in russian is just a victim [23:24] Me: and i realised my theory in my paper was completely wrong [23:24] Kyiv: you could write another paper with a new perspective [23:24] Me: im thinking about it [23:24] Me: hard to do these days [23:25] Me: think ill just collect sources and go about it slowly as i go [23:27] Me: unlike before i dont have resources like [23:27] Me: the ability to talk to a professor [23:27] Me: so its hard to get an essay going [23:27] Me: even harder to get it published [23:28] Kyiv: as for ukrainian refugees. i thought about it. i think it has a lot to do with christian slavs fleeing to their neighbouring christian slavs. maybe if arabs fled to the neighboring arabs it wouldnt be such a problem. [23:29] Me: i guess thats true [23:29] Me: its just the first two layers [23:29] Me: race and religion [23:29] Me: being met [23:29] Kyiv: ye [23:31] Me: man [23:31] Me: being not white is just [23:31] Me: youre just fucked by default [23:31] Me: but now [23:31] Me: even some white people are fucked [23:33] Kyiv: yeah. i wish i was not white [23:33] Me: imagine being not white in ukraine right now [23:34] Kyiv: at least i could blame white ppl [23:34] Me: you can still blame white people [23:35] Kyiv: gonna blame russians [23:35] Me: shit me too [23:36] Kyiv: dont even know how to feel about it all [23:37] Kyiv: on the one hand putin brainwashed the majority of his population and surrounded himself with oligarchs so its hard to get rid of him and people arent to blame [23:38] Kyiv: on the other hand putin wouldnt exist without the russian people and it is not putin who is carrying out the orders to bomb and shoot civilians [23:38] Kyiv: it kind of reminds me of german civilians who knew about holocaust and did nothing to stop it [23:39] Me: i guess that makes sense [23:40] Me: i guess theres no such thing as [23:40] Me: a correct answer to who exact is to blame [23:40] Me: people just decide that based on how much sympathy they have for different groups of people [23:40] Me: which i suppose go back to the layers like you mentioned previously [23:42] Kyiv: makes sense 5/3 [10:56] Kyiv: [21:59] Me: Thanks 4/3 14:25] Kyiv: man [14:26] Kyiv: so far ukraine is able to defend the flanks [14:27] Kyiv: and if the west is able to keep up its promises with weapons supply and russia doesnt get any support we might have a chance [14:27] Me: holy shit [14:27] Kyiv: things can go sideways any time [14:27] Me: chinas state banks all pulled out of russia [14:28] Me: i dont think a few extra hobos from belarus is going to make a difference [14:28] Kyiv: they might make an impact since they are walking distance from kyiv [14:28] Kyiv: and if we lose kyiv [14:28] Kyiv: its gg [14:29] Kyiv: but i think lukashenko pussied out of it [14:29] Kyiv: and balarusians dont wanna fight ukrainians [14:29] Me: does russia even need to worry about [14:29] Me: supply lines or whatever [14:29] Me: arent they all based in eastern ukraine now [14:29] Me: and going to kyiv from there [14:30] Kyiv: its still a long way from the eastern front. i think they banked on the troops in the north to take kyiv in no time [14:30] Kyiv: but that didnt go according to plan [14:30] Kyiv: so far [14:30] Kyiv: there is still a threat from north [14:30] Kyiv: and they are taking a lot of land from the south as well [14:31] Me: fuck [14:31] Me: cant wait for sabaton to write a song about this [14:31] Kyiv: listened to the new sabaton new album yesterday [14:31] Kyiv: idk bro [14:31] Kyiv: didnt really like it [14:32] Kyiv: i think if there was no great war album id actually be able to enjoy it [14:33] Me: yea i know what you mean [14:33] Me: every part of it was a masterpiece [14:33] Kyiv: it might be that their greatest album is great war and everything they release now is just going to be compared to it [14:33] Me: man [14:33] Me: honestly cant believe kyiv still exists [14:33] Kyiv: same [14:34] Kyiv: if we can hold for one more week [14:34] Kyiv: well know if ukraine has a chance or not [14:35] Kyiv: if we win [14:35] Kyiv: i dont even fucking know bro [14:35] Kyiv: its like [14:35] Kyiv: everything that didnt make sense would make even less sense [14:36] Me: i feel like i havent been living in different reality for so long [14:36] Me: real life is just absolute insanity [14:36] Me: everything is a paradox [14:36] Me: gotta fucking [14:36] Me: retreat back into my corner of perplexity bruh [14:37] Kyiv: mr gibson would approve [14:37] Kyiv: cant fucking believe this shit is happening [14:38] Kyiv: biden warned everyone that the attack was imminent but people just couldn;t fathom this course of events [14:38] Kyiv: it just defied any logic [14:38] Kyiv: and then all of a sudden it became reality [14:38] Kyiv: and everyone was like [14:38] Kyiv: shenme [14:40] Me: yea man [14:40] Me: russians came [14:40] Me: and ukrainians were like [14:40] Me:  [14:40] Kyiv: the nuclear threat is kinda fucked tho [14:41] Kyiv: cant even get iodine pills anywhere [14:41] Me: man [14:42] Me: arent private pharm companies starting to supply them [14:43] Kyiv: russians kadirov troops which are basically muslim extremists took over the chernobyl and zaporozhian nuclear power plants [14:44] Kyiv: cant predict anything when those fgts are involved [14:44] Kyiv: the pills are all out of stock [14:45] Me: fuck [14:47] Me: oh its chechens [14:47] Me: i can see that being worrying [14:48] Kyiv: the chechens that fled the chechen wars in russia are now fighting on our side now [14:49] Kyiv: thats a good thing since they are well trained and have personal hatred toward russian chechens [14:51] Kyiv: NATOs inability to help out with troops and securing ukraines airspace is kinda frustrating but i guess well just have to do with what we have [14:51] Kyiv: the promised jets are taking a while tho [14:51] Me: i mean its like [14:51] Me: does nato really want to be a friend of ukraine [14:52] Me: or do they just want russia to take as many losses as possible [14:52] Me: without costing them anything [14:52] Kyiv: in my opinion [14:52] Kyiv: nato just wants russia to lose [14:52] Kyiv: but they dont want an open conflict with them [14:52] Kyiv: cuz it would essentially mean ww3 [14:53] Kyiv: so they are just supplying us with weapons [14:53] Kyiv: disregarding the losses we might endure [14:54] Kyiv: im at the same time grateful and displeased [14:55] Kyiv: what are you doing rn [14:55] Me: being depressed [14:55] Kyiv: good Kyiv started a call that lasted 2 hours. (unrecorded conversation) Kyiv: If we can hold kyiv for 7 days, we might have a chance to fight back Me: Is there a specific reason for like seven days or Kyiv: There is a specific reason, its because he utilised 9% of the fucking military force that he planted across the fucking border. And everything fucking went sideways. So within seven days, the army that he amassed at the borders is going to be destroyed if we hold on the resistance and if Kiev doesnt collapse because he has already run out of supplies, because he has been bombarding the fucking cities non-stop hes running out of fucking ammunition. And the factories that manufacture ammunition cannot supply him with enough ammunition to keep going. So he kind of went all in on Ukraine, but he failed because he did not anticipate the kind of resistance and the support from the woods. Because he thought that wasnt going to do the same shit as Donbass and Crimea, just ignore the issue Me: I watched a seminar about this, it was like an older recorded one from like, 2015 or so when Crimea was just taken. They mentioned how the West wanted to expand influence into Ukraine without making Ukraine a part of EU or NATO. And Russia wanted Ukraine to be like, how do you say, kind of like a border country between Russia and the West,. Kyiv: It expands beyond that. If you listen to Russian news, I mean, with subtitles, or if you took enough Russian classes, you can just watch the originals, its fucking insane. He basically says that were a brother nation and hes liberating us from the Nazi role. And he wants to reunite Ukraine and Russia, basically to reinstate the USSR. And the majority of Russian people support it. Just a few days ago, there was a fucking, you know like, street kind of questionnaire, I suppose. They were like, do you want to see pictures from Ukraine after the invasion? And do you still support Putin and after you see these pictures, and a lot of people are like, I dont even want to see the pictures, I support Putin because Hes our leader, and he is liberating Ukraine from the Nazi rule. And at this point, Im just questioning myself. Before I was like, okay, Russian people, they just have to unite. Like the youth has to unite and just like basically, go for revolution at this point, because thats the only way but now, I think that Russia has to be fucking nuked. Theres just no hope for Russia because the majority of people is not the youth, it is the people who support Putin. Me: This is insane. to even think about. This feels like something Kyiv: All the fucking opposition TV channels, radio stations and media channels were closed because they were talking about Russia invading Ukraine, and the whole mentioning of Russia invading Ukraine and not being the fucking special operation, as they call it, and not a liberation mission is basically a national crime now, and anyone who says that Russia is invading Ukraine is going to be sentenced to 15 years in jail. Its basically becoming North Korea this point. Me: its hard to even imagine that this is shit thats happening now, you know. I guess the last time something like this happened that was comparable was when the Americans invaded Iraq but that was almost 20 years ago Kyiv: I dont know bro the kind of broken propaganda thats happening in Russia right now use like the Soviet propaganda because the even released the fucking cartoons for kids that Ukraine was friends with Russia. But then Ukraine went to a different button class and they met Americans and European countries. Thats like an actual fucking cartoon, Ukraine went to different class, they got new friends and then they started chasing after the fucking proclaimed Donetsk and Lugansk Republics. Theyre actually like kids in fucking flags. Their clothes are painted in flags, and Ukraine is chasing after them with a stick and Russia is standing up for them. The pinnacle of that cartoon is that Russia takes the stick from the Ukrainian kid. And the kids in like dress in the fucking American and European clothes. Theyre like shaming that fucking Russian kid for taking the stick from Ukrainian kid. When my mom watched that cartoon, she was like, bruh this is fucking USSR, this is the shit we watched when we were fucking kids. Russia is basically regressing into USSR but at this point they have even less power than before. Me: I dont know. Some people Im talking to are like, man, you know, its not the Russians is just Putin. But like I dont know, where does Putins power come from, right, like theres people who support him. If like everyone in Russia didnt like Putin, this wouldnt happen. Kyiv: [russian] people in the streets that are fighting for independence, for Ukraine I suppose or at least to stop the work, Im thankful to those people, but the people who support Putin, or who are neutral theyre basically the enemies of the state. Because people who are neutral and do not take stance on either one of those positions are basically supporting Putin because inactivity indirectly supports Putin. Me: I guess that makes sense. Im just thinking if you were a Russian in Russia, and you didnt support the war, what would you do? Do you protest and get arrested instantly? Do you like defect to Ukraine? Like how many options do you really have, you know? Kyiv: Well, its hard to say from this position that I am in right now. But hypothetically, I would probably go out and protest because its the only chance to overtake the government because revolutions always ends in blood, a proper revolution, the kind that has effect. Whatever the fuck they doing right now is not having any effect because theyre fucking pussies. Just like the revolution that we had in the fucking 2014 People went on the streets and a lot of people died but we had new democratic government, but democracy, I feel like democracy is just like an unknown concept to Russia. They just long for a fucking monarchy or autocracy? Me: Wasnt the Ukrainian president that got overthrown democratically elected? Kyiv: No, he rigged the election just like Lukashenko did. A lot of people voted for him, but it wasnt enough to get the victory so he rigged the election. People kind of revolted then, but it was kind of subdued. But when it all really started when he promised the Ukrainian people that he would join the EU. But then he went to the Congress, and he said that he would not join the EU because it would worsen the relationship with Russia and it wouldnt wouldnt be in the interest of Ukraine to join the EU and thats when the people finally revolted because they were like, we want to have nothing to do with fucking Russia because theyre fucking retarded and theyre oppressing, we want to be a part of EU because we dont want to be in USSR at this point. Then it just fucking went sideways and a lot of people died but he fled to Russia and so did a lot of his ministers and politicians so we elected the new government, democratically at least. Me: I remember when Kyiv: What we have right now that is deemed fucking Nazi in Russia for some reason was democratically elected as well. And the election was not rigged this time. Me: I remember when Zelenskyy first got elected and we talked about it and you were making fun of how all the choices were bad and the guy that got chosen used to be a comedian but now its war and hes stepping up Kyiv: Well, I mean, yeah, I still hold on to the position because economically, when he was president without war, it was not all that good but now the situation were at right now, hes stepping up as not only a president, he is like the major commander of the army and the resistance against the Russian invaders and he is performing even better than I couldnt even anticipate Me: I guess its kind of like Churchill isnt it? People called him a good leader during war but Kyiv: Yes, like hes a war time champion, but when the peace time happens its just, Oh, man cant wait to get rid of this guy Me: Either way, the fact Zelenskyy is out in the streets in the city actively being attacked while Putin is fucking around in a bunker is pretty funny. Kyiv: Before, I was making fun of this guy, but if he goes for a second term, Ill fucking vote for him bruh. Me: Ey Kyiv: because like, this shit was unexpected, and I did not expect him to behave this way. And since hes behaving this way, hes fucking earned my respect. Me: Im sure you guys got this. Kyiv: Fucking hope so, theres no other way. Cant believe this shit is happening. I dont know, it was kind of a weird feeling because when I started writing again I thought back to like the poems and the stuff I was writing in high school. I thought Id definitely write something meaningful to myself in Russian. Then I thought I would probably write something English. But at this point I feel like writing in Ukrainian would be more liberating I guess. Writing in Ukrainian nowadays seems more natural. And since this is the first time writing in Ukrainian, it feels like Im not actually mimicking anyone, you know what I mean? Because when I write in Russian, I dont try to mimic but it just happens that I mimic the people Ive read and same thing in English, I mimic the people that I read. But, in Ukrainian, since I havent read shit in Ukrainian, it doesnt feel like Im mimicking anyone. If I had I might feel like I was mimicking someone else too Me: Maybe youre mimicking yourself Kyiv: Fuck me, worst case scenario What about the blog the other person suggested Me: Oh, Im still making it one of my friends is helping me finish making the website. Were making a really minimalistic GitHub website where theres like nothing except for the text so like it feels more isolated. Kyiv: I have an archive of some really explicit pictures I would say Me: of the war or of yourself Kyiv: nothing explicit about myself Me: I dont know, I mean, Im not gonna ask you to like send shit to me that you dont want to write but theres anything you think is interesting that maybe I could make into a project to go public. (private conversation) Me: So, now is your main thing just building hedgehogs? Kyiv: No, it was just a one-time order because the place where our factory is in a hot zone now. So were basically supplying our workers who live at the factory with food. They have enough food for now. Theyll be able to last for seven days at least, maybe two weeks? Well, the hot zone is northeast of Kiev, where all the action happens so were kind of in the danger zone. At this point were just hoping that all the stuff that we have so far doesnt get destroyed. But, I dont think thats the main concern right now. The main concern is just that Russia doesnt take over Kyiv and Ukraine is whole and they dont instate their own government because thatll be a fucking disaster. There will be the end of it. The end of everything I suppose. Me: yeah that makes sense what do you think are the chances of you ending up actually fighting Kyiv: Well, if Kyiv is surrounded and ends up in a complete blockade, Ill end up fighting. Because right now ,like even this guy, my coworker, he volunteered on day two, I think. He went there but they didnt really have any weapons, it was three weapons for 10 people or 2 for 10 people. It was fucking stOnks at this point. Were now waiting for the western supplies but, for now, we have enough volunteers and drafted people who are able to fight in the army right now so were good. But if Kyiv ends up in a blockade or ends up in a situation when normal people have to go out in the streets because the militarys done enough, Ill probably go, (private conversation) Me: Thats kind of true, isnt it Kyiv: True, but at this point, if a rock gets thrown at me Ill die anyways, because I wont be thrown rocks at by people, it will be by fucking shells and I will just be done right there I dont give a shit, bro. Because this point, I cannot even imagine myself living in any different country. I tried China. I tried Canada. And those two countries are pretty good countries to live in, you know? But I still felt out of place. Ukraine is the only country I feel like I belong to and it feels wrong not to fight for it. Me: I know what you mean Kyiv: Right now, I cannot do anything, but if the resistance comes to a point where it doesnt even matter what you can do and becomes just about showing up and doing whatever you can to resist. Ill fucking do it. I dont care. Cant imagine living under Russian rule The problem with whats going on here is the Russians were told they were doing training, but then people start fighting back so they fight too and start finding out this isnt training, this is something else. But this is where the problems start, all the soldiers that were captured, most of them were born in 2000-2001. And they all say the same shit. Theyre like, Oh, we dont know where we were, we dont know what the fuck were doing, we were shooting at the fucking civilian buildings as part of the training. Here is where comes the question: Are they lying? Or is this the kind of thing theyre told to say when they were captured? Oh, we didnt know what the fuck or whatever. We didnt know what the fuck were doing. I guess this is part of the training (private conversation) Kyiv: The thing is, apart from my experience, like the entire fight, the war, all the stuff that I get is still a second-hand experience. Like yeah, I see stuff on the news. But thats the people taking pictures, then it gets then it gets circulated by the news, and the media and their telegram channels and like the activists and all that crap and then I witness the end result. So, the experience that I get are just secondhand. My personal experience is just like my ruminations and speculation of what might happen know what might not happen. Like how the death toll that is still unknown from both sides Me: I mean, if you like, dont want me to publish it, then like, I get it, right. Its just, I dont know, its like, Kyiv: not that I dont want you to Oh, its more like, Im just wondering what its gonna be. Me: Well, its just, I want to make this as raw as possible. Like, I dont want to do a really fantastical version of things. I dont think everything needs to be completely accurate, because its still about perspective, right? Its just if I didnt talk to you every day, then I wouldnt know anything about anything, you know? Like, really, when it comes to my motivation, thats it. Like, the only reason I know anything about whats happening is because Im talking to you. If all I did was watch the news, all I would see is just people saying, oh, man, so like, yeah, Russia invaded Ukraine. Thats why gas prices are high. And that doesnt help me. Kyiv: I mean, Im just wondering if I can, like, probably gather more intel from like, the media and experiences that people have. Because if its just my experience, then its just gonna be, I guess, sort of unimportant because Im just, Im not in the war zone. Im just kind of like, in the outskirts of Kiev where barely anything happens. A lot of people here have a way harder time than me. Me: I dont think you need to compete with other people about how hard the times are. I feel like whenever something bad happens, like both of us, its our nature for our first instinct to be well, you know, this is kind of shit. But other people probably have it worse. So I dont really get to complain. But Im just thinking that might not be how it always gotta be. Kyiv: Oh, definitely know what you mean. Me: Yeah. Like any perspective is helpful. The closest that people who are not firsthand experiencing something can get to the truth is by understanding as many perspectives as possible. So in that sense, your perspective is just as important as anyone elses. Kyiv: Yeah, but in that sense, it would make more sense to gather more perspective around Me: True, but I dont know anyone like I know you. I dont just mean I dont know anyone else in Ukraine like I know you. I mean I dont know anyone anywhere like I know you. So, if I personally wrote about anyone else, it wouldnt work. Me: So, in this way, me personally, I cant write about anyone elses perspective. Even though having other peoples perspectives are helpful. Thats not something Im capable of doing, because the only person I actually know is you. Kyiv: That makes sense. But I feel like sometimes its hard to comprehend my own perspective. Like, its easier to speculate the other persons perspective and guess what they think, what they feel as opposed to exposing what you feel and what you see. Because a lot of the stuff that I see just goes in the backburner and you just dont really think about it, but might make an impact for some people. Its just the reality. I dont really think about it that much. Im just like oh, yeah, of course that happened because thats the reality right now. But for other people it will be like, holy shit what the fuck Sometimes, its hard to remember those times because its such a norm at this point, you know Its fucked up to say but it is a norm at this point for people to die and for people to get demolished in a fucking airstrike. And when people say like, whats up? I dont say that shit. I just say like, Well, yeah, everything is as usual. But nobody knows what it entails, except for me. So, its hard to even describe for myself how I feel about this whole predicament. (private conversation) Kyiv: I really hate the word interview. Like I really hate what it implies, just interview. It feels like its not talking to people its interview, like you want to get something out of it. Me: Yeah, I know you mean, it feels less personal. I dont know, maybe Im just emotionally traumatised from job interviews. Its always I see that you do not have any experience in this industry, so what makes you think that you can work here though? How do I get experience if I dont got jobs. I didnt even have the work experience to join the Foreign Legion bro. What the fuck Kyiv: I mean, what the fuck did you expect bro Me: I dont know, I thought maybe I could just like get there and die instantly and I could become fertiliser you guys might need afterwards I dont know my brain hasnt been working. Its like what I said earlier, nothing feels real and I dont know what Im doing anymore. (private conversation) Kyiv: There are things I need to be alive for, but, at the same time. I feel wrong for other people to die for me. Me: Remember that really old text we had? Well, not that old, like a week ago where I said, this is a lose lose situation because whether you fight or dont fight, you will betray someone. And then you said well, actually, I dont know anyone crazy enough to join. But now its actually become that situation. So we just need to decide who are you more willing to betray? Kyiv: I feel like when Im fighting, Im betraying myself Me: Are you willing to betray yourself? Kyiv: For some reason, to me, betraying myself is not as dire or devastating as betraying _______. I dont know how to explain it. But I feel like like my responsibility before _______ overweighs my responsibility for myself and despite me willing to fight, I cannot even fathom the idea of _______ suffering as a result of me dying. Even though it sounds kind of selfish, in a way, because it sounds like Im just using an excuse for not fighting. But to be honest, I wanted to fucking die a long time before I even comprehended this fucking idea. In the end, I never cared about dying, but I really I really care about _______, and I wouldnt really want _________________. But to be honest, if it was not for _______. I would join on the fucking 24th of February. If anyone else wanted to stop me, I wouldnt care. (private conversation) Me: Yeah, this is your internal journey. This is your story. Your story is in the fucking making. dont know, we write a lot of stories, you know. We always think fuck, the internal journey here is not good, the external journey here is not good. But how many people live and die with an actual journey of their own. Your journey here means something to you so it might mean something to other people. This is the only kind of memoir that makes sense. If I ever write one, its just gonna be about me applying to jobs and getting rejected for 10 years and then dying in a ditch. Thats not gonna help people but yours might. Kyiv: Your memoir is gonna be about fishing with your granddad then planting fucking tomatoes in the shade that actually fucking grows. Thatll be fucking impressive. Me: How he planted tomatoes in the gravel, I dont even know bruh Kyiv: Nobody even knew it was possible. Honestly, though, like, do you think theres any reason to even post this shit? Like if I were to write a memoir, should I even share it with anyone? Me: I think you should. I think this is important. Ive written so much bullshit that doesnt do anything except just be mildly entertaining like _________. But the most famous writers die really young and they live really troubled lives. But I think theres no way to be good at writing without going through those experiences. Like for a writer, being depressed and paranoid for 20 years and then killing yourself at the age of 22 is completely normal. But thats just, Kyiv: yeah, I know, I read Bukowski. And because he says shit like, I was lucky enough to have a shit life. Me: Its not being a writer that causes it. Kyiv: Exactly, you cant be good at writing without those things. So its not writing causes the experiences. Its just the experiences. But this is barely a shit situation. Im here in the countryside, smoking shisha, having decent internet and warm and clothed. I have food to eat. Like I have nothing to complain about except for my inner struggles about this fuckin external situation. Me: internal struggles out the most important thing Kyiv: I just feel wrong about not being out there with the other guys just fighting for the freedom. Its like the Donbass conflict, fucking Putin and Poroshenko and whoever the fuck decided that shit, I didnt want to die in that conflict. But this time, this time is actually the Patriotic War. This is the war for independence. This is the war for freedom. This is the war that decides the future of this nation. And I didnt think I would even say this out loud, but right now it feels like I am a patriot because I want to die for this country. But the only thing that is stopping me is just shitty fucking guilt (private conversation) Kyiv: Aye bro, your brother from another mother. Jokes aside, I really consider people that are not blood related my family as well and youre part of that family. And Im not just like saying that lightly, like I really mean it. Because I really do consider us family because you can just come here anytime you want. I mean I dont mean now, like when things blow over, just come here. And if ______ doesnt block me or just fucking deport me again, Ill come to ________ Me: I dont know if what Im fucking saying makes any sense anymore, but Ive been trying to make it as a fucking writer for so long and pushing hard in personal ambitions and thats been a completely futile endeavour. But when we were in high school, we talked about what duty a person has. I remember this conversation well because you talked to T______ about it. Like if your country told you to kill civilians, would you do it? And T______ said he probably would. Then we had a discussion about that where we disagreed. You said you feel that loyalty is mostly about loyalty to our friends and family. But I argued that loyalty is mostly about being loyal to a cause or a personal ambition or something like that, but I think you were right the whole time. Kyiv: I mean, I dont really remember that conversation but I remember B______ and T_____s argument about bombing civilians. Yeah, like I guess loyalty to family and friends is the only thing we have since being loyal to cause could imply anything, it might imply any losses, any victories, but in the end, all you have is cause itself. And what cost does it come at? The victory of a cause. The victory of an idea. This is basically ideology, like do you die for your cause or do you die for your family and friends? Or directly related to you directly responsible for you and youre directly responsible for them? Or do you die for the cause that is implied upon you by the government or the society or yourself? I feel like family and friends like the only way to go. Because I remember there was another conversation about if your friend committed a crime or your family member committed a crime, would you give them in to the police? And obviously the answer is no because thats your family Im gonna give it away. I dont really give a shit about the fucking law system because its fucking rigged, like I dont care about justice when it comes to my family because I would just want to make my family out of that fucking predicament, I cant care about fucking justice at this point (private conversation) Kyiv: Thanks man, it really means a lot. Like, it does sound cringe when people say it really means a lot to me but like I really do mean it because for a long time youve already been part of my family so definitely I dont really perceive you as a friend anymore, its just like, you know, well, its just [my name] Me: Yeah, I cant believe I blocked you on Discord so many times. I also cant believe the biggest problem I had these last few weeks haemorrhoids. I mean I gotta admit theyre pretty painful and I still have them, like theyre still really hurting right now but compared to everything else is not that bad. What do you think is more painful, having haemorrhoids or your country being invaded? Kyiv: Definitely haemorrhoids, its a personal attack just to you. I dont know, bro. I just want to believe that maybe in a year from now, maybe even less than that, youll just come here and well smoke shisha and well just watch some old cartoons just like nothing has ever even fucking occurred here. Thatll be a really fucking dope feeling. As for your writing carrier, I feel like you just have to give it time because you have to have experience to write something meaningful, right? Me: I dont know. I dont really Kyiv: Like I know Stephen King just shits out a novel every fucking three weeks but I mean thats Stephen King, bro Me: I dont want you to fucking give a shit about my writing career right now. Its not really the time. I think right now, when we think about writing, we should think about your memoir Kyiv: My memoir will come in a while. Ill keep writing it but I hope to finish it after the war ends and hopefully the odds are in our favour because if the odds are not in our favour I will not finish my memoir Fucking hate talking about this petty shit like how my country just got bombarded. Lets just talk about some more meaningful shit Me: Lets talk about that one part from Avatar. Kyiv: Thats rough buddy Me: I liked the part where they had the beach episode. Man, Ty Lee was such a good character, she didnt know what she was doing she was just having fun. Remember when she was like haha, isnt it funny how like everyone here just comes up and talks to me and Azula was like thats because youre a whore then she starts crying and I was like wait a sec Kyiv: Just because youre not a whore, you dont have to make fun of other whores Me: What is going on? Such a good show.  Today at 14:55 3/3 [02:10] Me: [08:19] Kyiv: https://youtu.be/82oJt2enz8A [12:50] Me: oh shit video games 2/3 [00:36] Kyiv: [00:36] Kyiv: looters [00:36] Kyiv: yer money or yer life [00:37] Me: the fuck happened to them [00:37] Kyiv: they got caught looting [00:38] Kyiv: theyre lucky to be alive cuz there was an order to shoot looters on sight [00:38] Me: are they just [00:39] Me: ukrianians who started looting because things were going to shit [00:39] Kyiv: ye [00:39] Me: you best not be a manhunter [00:39] Kyiv: traitors [00:39] Me: i like how they both have socks [00:40] Me: bruh did you take that picture [00:40] Me: reverse google search no results [00:41] Kyiv: people also tie looters to lampposts with stretch foil and call the police [00:41] Kyiv: reminds me of spoderman movies [00:41] Kyiv: when he just shot looters with his jizz and called the police [00:44] Me: fuck [00:44] Me: spoderman why you shot web [00:44] Me: man thats old [00:47] Kyiv: [00:47] Kyiv: spoderman [00:47] Kyiv: spoderman [00:47] Me: fuck this is just like spoderman [00:47] Me: man [00:48] Me: remember playing [00:48] Me: spoderman fortnite [00:48] Me: good times [00:48] Kyiv: ye [00:48] Kyiv: the only good thing about that game [00:49] Me: this is so sad despacito kill myself [00:50] Me: how do police even have time to deal with looters [00:51] Kyiv: i dont even know. there are a lot of volunteers that patrol the streets. they are the ones that catch the looters. the police arrest them whenever they have time i guess. [00:51] Kyiv: so they could be tied to the lampposts for hours [00:52] Me: classic manhunters [00:52] Kyiv: what r u doing r n [00:52] Me: makes sense its a shit time to be looting [00:52] Me: applying to jobs [00:52] Me: i got rejected to 8 more since we last spoke [00:52] Kyiv: gg Kyiv started a call that lasted an hour. (unrecorded conversation) Kyiv: I think they were just expecting to be greeted with flowers like they were in donesk and luhansk, but when they went deeper, old people in villages were throwing themselves under tanks to stop them. Our defence minister said, they will keep being greeted with flowers but they will be on their graves. Me: I guess for Ukraine, nationalism and patriotism is only really high right now because its just gotten attacked. But the fact that so many civilians are willing to just die for the cause right now. I feel like most places in the world, among the general populace at least, they just dont have that Kyiv: I guess theres just an ongoing struggle for freedom and identity that kind of instils this patriotism and nationalism in people. Like constant wars and oppression from Russian side, 20th century was basically hell. It was like you were persecuted just for being Ukrainian. So that kind of instils that strong identity when youre among Russians. When you live in Soviet Union, and youre Ukrainian and they hear you speak Ukrainian, then youre instantly a fucking low life retard, so you have to speak Russian so that people dont think youre retarded. Me: That makes sense Kyiv: of that kind of, you know. Theres perpetual anger growing inside of you, toward Russians, and a kind of longing to be Ukrainian and to finally have a country and nation thats united and strong enough to fend off all theI guessavenge all the things that happened. Me: I guess if you put it like that, its like the experience Ive been discussing with my ____ recently. Theres just a lot of similarities with the resistance against the Japanese he was there for, you know? Its not really necessarily liking a country or idea to a certain degree, but you eventually get tired of being slaves. And everyone who just doesnt want to be slaves and have barely anything else in common just unite. Kyiv: I guess that makes sense. Me: What a time to fucking be alive bro. Didnt think Id fucking see this shit. Well, you know what? I guess I did think I would see this day eventually. Just not so soon, you know? Kyiv: Man, everyone thought Putin was bluffing. Except for Americans, they were like bruh theyre gonna invade at any time now. But Ukrainians were like nah, bro are you joking? Me: bro look at this though. I still have a cat at least Kyiv: piece of shit. Me: Aw man So, its been a few days What do you think the chances of Ukraine still being in country by the time this shits over Kyiv: Chances are pretty high, the question is how much damage will we endure? Because Russians have been bombing major cities, destroying old infrastructure, hospitals, kindergartens, schools, just regular buildings where people live. Theres already a lot of damage done and its not over yet Me: that makes sense Kyiv: and how much of it how much land well be able to retain by the end Me: Kind of weird that, militarily, in terms of like actual military forces not just like, Bro you want like five bullets? Isnt it kinda funny that there are countries sending military to help Russia but no ones helping Ukraine even though the entire worlds like aw man, pray for Ukraine Kyiv: What do you mean military, do you mean Belarus Me: Is it just Belarus? Kyiv: Well, I mean, there are Chechens but Chechens are part of Russia. I mean, Ukraine is now opening for volunteers from several countries the chechen that fled the country during the war kind of want to go back to Ukraine and fight the chechen that won the war because the Chechen that won the war are all retarded. There are Belarusians in Ukraine that disagree with Lukashenko and they, too, want to join the war. The Foreign Legion, dutch volunteers, well I mean theres several. Its not a lot but its still something Me: I guess it helps morale at least Kyiv: Yeah, well the weapons are good and apparently Russians cannot fucking fight. Like I dont know what the fuck their strategy is but theyve already lost a shit ton. A convoys just been deployed here and it all immediately got destroyed by fucking Turkish planes and whatever gets close to the cities, or is already in the cities, gets destroyed by a fucking military or paramilitary stingers and javelins. Me: Fuck I was expecting just babushkas and molotovs bruh Kyiv: Well that happens, too. In villages, people make molotovs and they destroyed btrs Me: Frugal living Yeah I remember when we talked when this first started? You were like, fuck, I guess we will disappear in five minutes. And then somehow Ukraine is doing well. Well, I guess you cant really do well in this situation but its not as bad as expected Kyiv: Ukrainian military is doing surprisingly well. Thats pretty good. And a lot of people are coming back from other countries, my dads friend from childhood who lives in Canada is already on the way to the Ukraine to fight the war. Me: fuck I wish I was on the way Man, I was super ready to join the Foreign Legion I was like fuck if Im gonna die I might as well be fighting the Russians bro theres no better way to die (private) Kyiv: just like in Call of Duty Me: exactly Kyiv: I was always asking myself like why do they always make Russians the enemy until now Me: Do you remember that one satire video about a Call of Duty pro player who joined ISIS and then got quickscoped thats a classic Then they asked his friends what do you think happened and they said, fuck, maybe he got fucking spawncamped by some asshole. You got to spawn camp the Russians dude, just go to Moscow now. Kyiv: Holy shit bro, just kill Putin. Putin is just sitting in some bunker. Nobody knows where he is. Me: I guess we saw that coming. Man, is Zelenskyy still in Kyiv. Thats pretty impressive, didnt the last two presidents both flee to Russia or something? Kyiv: Well, in 2014, the president, the prime minister and some other fucking politicians fled to Russia and theyre still in Russia. I think I saw them on the news just a few days ago. Theyre all like, Well, yeah, there is a Nazi rule in Ukraine, so you got to liberate the country. And I was like, Oh man, there was Poroshenko he was a president for like four or five years. Me: I mean, Kyiv: Part of the reason why this defense was so successful was due to Poroshenko. He had many faults, like his way of dealing with the oligarchs was just kind of sus. But he kind of reinvented the training military, because everything before that were just non existant. There was zero budget, and in the military, we had no soldiers and nothing. When the war in Donbass started, he started investing a lot of money in military so at least when Russia invaded we had some soldiers and military bases and defences Me: You think youre going to fight? Kyiv: Well, people who volunteer to fight say that theres like fucking three guns for 10 people because theyre just too many volunteers and not enough weaponry. So if I were to join now, I wouldnt have a weapon, I will just be following the others while catching looters and tying them to lightpoles. Me: yeah so instead of joining a kingdom, you can just be the roaming war party just fighting looters. Thats just the early game, you know, then you can go to tournaments. Kyiv: Can I quicksave? Me: This is like one of those times when you start the game and say dont let me quit without saving then you get stuck in a wall and lose all your progress. Kyiv: Worse than dying bruh Me: I guess catching looters is pretty important, other people need that shit Kyiv: We do construction so we got an order from the Ukrainian military to construct hedgehogs. Me: Dont you guys only have four people working for you? Kyiv: Around four people in the office but heres like 20 people at the factory Me: Thats good because I remember last time I was talking to you about it and you were driving like, yeah, I need to go to the factory because someone else was supposed to go but he disappeared Kyiv: I dont know, everythings fucking gone dude Me: Was it like the guy who got kidnapped and chained to the radiator What are you guys building Kyiv: hedgehogs Me: what are those Kyiv: Have you seen clips from war movies, like on the beach at d-day, the fucking giant metal spikes? Me: Oh, those are called hedgehogs, I didnt even know that Kyiv: Yeah, just to stop tanks Me: I wrote about them in this story, I called them barricades because I googled spiky shit and it didnt come up with anything Kyiv: come on bro Me: fuck Kyiv: Its so hard to do anything useful. If I go there theres nothing for me to do since no weapons, if I stay here, theres nothing for me to do since Im just watching them build. So fucking useless Me: Make molotovs at home Kyiv: No ingredients. At home I have a pistol with rubber bullets, most I can do is probably shoot myself in the head Me: You probably wont even die, just hurts Kyiv: you can actually die Me: well it depends like the gun right Kyiv: its a 9 mil pistol Me: guess it depends more on the bullet Kyiv: theres still gunpowder in it, just the metal part is replaced with rubber Me: severe brain damage Kyiv: if you get shot in the eye or the temple or maybe even the liver, you might die Me: Remember that meme about stalker with the guy holding pistol like shotgun and it just says you wont miss because fear of shooting hand I remember this video of a guy playing vr Counter Strike. And he was dual wielding AKs. But if you hold it in one hand, if you shoot one bullet, the recoil would just knock it out your hand. So he tried to rush the door with the AKs and he only shot two bullets and both guns bounced off and then he died. Kyiv: Remember we played paintball and _____ was there just going fucking terminator mode and would hold two guns and he would just walk like this with two guns and shoot at the tent where people are hiding. But like while he was walking there, he got shot like 20 times but he wouldnt stop Me: I know, I was one of the people who shot him good times (private conversation) (call ends) [01:47] Me: [01:48] Kyiv: [01:48] Kyiv: sanic [01:48] Me: fucking [01:48] Me: hedgehogs [01:48] Me: didnt know they were called that until you start building them 29/2 [02:18] Me: hello?
