<h2>27/2</h2>
<p>[00:58] Me: someone suggested a blog with just the shit you’ve been saying from kyiv</p>
<p>[00:58] Me: do you mind if i go ahead with it</p>
<p>[00:59] Kyiv: go ahead. i dont mind</p>
<p>[01:00] Me: already i’ll see if it goes anywhere</p>
<p>[01:00] Me: talk to people about mediums tomorrow</p>
<p>[01:00] Me: man i dont know</p>
<p>[01:01] Me: feels like it’s in poor taste since everything is still currently fucked</p>
<p>[01:01] Me: but it might be good to get perspective out there</p>
<p>[01:01] Me: since all the news is created by people who aren’t even there</p>
<p>[01:01] Kyiv: i scan the local news, bbc, cnn, nyt, and the russian news</p>
<p>[01:02] Kyiv: russians are just living in a parallel universe</p>
<p>[01:02] Kyiv: they say they dont have any casualties</p>
<p>[01:02] Kyiv: and they are successfully liberating ukrainians from the nazi rule</p>
<p>[01:03] Kyiv: in the meantime more than 20k civilians took arms to defend against russians</p>
<p>[01:03] Kyiv: already a lot of footage of people mass producing molotovs</p>
<p>[01:03] Kyiv: to defend against btrs</p>
<p>[01:03] Me: what are btrs</p>
<p>[01:04] Me: man you know</p>
<p>[01:04] Me: i was talking with ____</p>
<p>[01:04] Me: and she mentioned how some people on chinese social media is taking it seriously</p>
<p>[01:04] Me: and i was thinking</p>
<p>[01:04] Me: getting invaded by an overwhelming force</p>
<p>[01:05] Me: all the civilians taking up arms and making homemade explosives to put up a futile fight</p>
<p>[01:05] Me: is just like the resistance against the japanese</p>
<p>[01:05] Me: but everyone still feels disconnected</p>
<p>[01:06] Me: to people forget about history too quickly or do people just not care about anythng happening directly to them</p>
<p>[01:06] Kyiv: either</p>
<p>[01:09] Kyiv: just got an update in the civilan force</p>
<p>[01:09] Kyiv: 37k in kiev alone</p>
<p>[01:11] Me: how is it recorded</p>
<p>[01:11] Me: do people register or is it an estimate</p>
<p>[01:11] Kyiv: everyone has to register</p>
<p>[01:12] Me: how does the civilian registeration work</p>
<p>[01:12] Kyiv:</p>
<p>272v1.mp4</p>
<p>[01:12] Me: do you need to register to get weapons</p>
<p>[01:12] Kyiv: ppl making molotovs</p>
<p>[01:12] Kyiv: yeah, you can’t just grab one</p>
<p>[01:13] Kyiv: i like this guy</p>
<p>[01:13] Kyiv:</p>
<p>2721.jpg</p>
<p>[01:13] Me: oh yeah i saw that one</p>
<p>[01:14] Me: do ukrainians generally have weapons at home</p>
<p>[01:14] Me: like can you just go outside with whatever you have and just shoot them</p>
<p>[01:14] Me: because 37k seems like a low number</p>
<p>[01:14] Me: for the civilian resistance</p>
<p>[01:14] Me: you got 3 million people in the city and only 37k want to fight?</p>
<p>[01:14] Kyiv: thats just the ones who officially registered</p>
<p>[01:14] Kyiv: and it’s only in kiev</p>
<p>[01:15] Kyiv: it’s only the third day. i think the number will keep growing</p>
<p>[01:15] Me: did you register</p>
<p>[01:15] Kyiv: not yet</p>
<p>[01:16] Kyiv: i told my mom that i should register</p>
<p>[01:16] Kyiv: and she said she’d die if something happened to me</p>
<p>[01:16] Kyiv: gg</p>
<p>[01:16] Kyiv: i hate these ultimatums</p>
<p>[01:17] Me: yea i know what you mean</p>
<p>[01:17] Me: same shit happens in my family all the time</p>
<p>[01:17] Me: i’m like i’m going to the grocery storea</p>
<p>[01:17] Me: and my mom says she’ll kill herself if i go out during covid</p>
<p>[01:17] Me: and i’m like</p>
<p>[01:17] Me: oh</p>
<p>[01:17] Me: slightly different situations though</p>
<p>[01:19] Kyiv: damn</p>
<p>[01:19] Kyiv:</p>
<p>2722.jpg</p>
<p>[01:24] Me: i remember that one time i got hit by a tank on my way to school when i was 10</p>
<p>[01:27] Me: are you guys armed with anything</p>
<p>[01:28] Kyiv: my mom has 9mm pistol with rubber bullets</p>
<p>[01:28] Kyiv: that’s about it tho</p>
<p>[01:28] Kyiv: there’s a baseball bat</p>
<p>[01:28] Kyiv: and an axe</p>
<p>[01:29] Kyiv: just come here</p>
<p>[01:29] Me: fuck that’s not a lot</p>
<p>[01:29] Kyiv: let’s make molotovs</p>
<p>[01:29] Kyiv: and watch avatar</p>
<p>[01:29] Me: ay lmao</p>
<p>[01:29] Me: i’m pretty sure i’m not allowed to go there anymore</p>
<p>[01:29] Kyiv: yeah probably not</p>
<p>[01:30] Me: all the borders inwards were already closed right</p>
<p>[01:30] Me: man i knew i should have gone to ukraine last year</p>
<p>[01:30] Me: if i went i could have died by now</p>
<p>[01:30] Kyiv: u missed ur chance</p>
<p>[01:30] Me: you know</p>
<p>[01:31] Me: from the police report of the vancouver riots</p>
<p>[01:31] Me: they made it with just petrols and rubbing alcohol</p>
<p>[01:31] Me: extra ghetto</p>
<p>[01:31] Kyiv: isn’t it just</p>
<p>[01:31] Kyiv: fuel and motor oil</p>
<p>[01:32] Me: official recipes include tar as well</p>
<p>[01:32] Kyiv: i don’t even know where to get tar</p>
<p>[01:32] Me: exactly</p>
<p>[01:32] Kyiv: gg</p>
<p>[01:32] Kyiv: i mean</p>
<p>[01:32] Kyiv: tar is optional</p>
<p>[01:32] Kyiv: for extra spice</p>
<p>[01:33] Me: just fill bottles with petrol alcohol and styrofoam and go protest your favourite hockey team losing</p>
<p>[01:33] Me: extra canadian</p>
<p>[01:33] Me: if it can burn down a cosmetics store it can probably kill russians</p>
<p>[01:33] Kyiv: can’t imagine caring about a sport team losing</p>
<p>[01:34] Me: honestly since what’s happening</p>
<p>[01:34] Me: it’s hard to imagine caring about anything</p>
<p>[01:34] Me: like i got a fracture snowboarding yesterday</p>
